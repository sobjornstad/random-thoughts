This is the public portion of <span class="Formatted">*Random Thoughts*</span>, a giant text file of quotations, stories, mini-essays, and anything else that was on my mind that I didn't have a good place to put. It's similar to the old idea of a commonplace book. You can read more about Random Thoughts in my Zettelkasten: <a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#RandomThoughts">https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#RandomThoughts</a>.

I'm Soren Bjornstad, a software developer, tech thinker, writer, and information systems designer. For more about me, see <a href="https://sorenbjornstad.com">https://sorenbjornstad.com</a>.

I've been writing in Random Thoughts since October 2009, when I was a freshman in high school. You may wish to read this page from bottom to top -- that way, you'll start with the items that are most relevant in today's context.

If you found a reference to an individual entry in here somewhere else, which in my writings typically looks something like "RT 5995", you can type '#5995' as an anchor at the end of the URL to jump there. If you don't jump there, sorry, that entry isn't public (see below). For the same reason, some internal links to other numbered entries won't do anything.

You may notice that the numbers are not in neat sequence -- that's because those missing entries are not for public consumption. I try to be conservative about what I make public, particularly when it involves quoting people who aren't public figures, so as not to risk landing unflattering information on anybody's Google search results, but in a 500,000-word document I'd be surprised if I haven't misclassified an entry or two. If I've published something you don't think should be public, please email 'zettelkasten@sorenbjornstad.com' and I'll look at taking it out.

I don't save only things that I agree with. If you encounter an idea in here, you can safely assume that I find it interesting (or did at the time I originally recorded it), but not that it perfectly aligns with my opinions.

This page is formatted in your browser using vim's ':TOhtml' command and a little bit of Python magic. It's not incredibly pretty, but I've been reading it more or less this way for 14 years and it's quite functional!

What is purple money, you may ask? Well, simply put, it's money that is purple. And just so there's no confusion, No, we do not accept purple money. Why? Because it's purple, that's why. Money is not supposed to be purple. You know how I know? Because I've seen money before. And it wasn't purple. So, from now on if anyone tries to pay with purple money (or blue, or red, or any other color that clearly does not look like normal money), apologize to the customer and tell them we simply cannot accept that money. If anyone has any questions about our purple money policies, please let me know." <span class="Underlined">--Emailsfromcrazypeople.com</span>

<span class="PreProc" id="105">@105.</span> Got Windows 7. Don't know if my processor is 64-bit or not (and Google couldn't supply the answer for some stupid reason), so I'm not sure whether to install the 64-bit or 32-bit version. I'm also considering upgrading motherboard and processor (and maybe RAM) at the same time because product activation can get screwed up when you do that and I know I'm going to want to some time. I have enough money too, just debating when to do it. And of course, there's that nasty chance that something much better will come out right after you buy.

<span class="PreProc" id="131">@131.</span> Got back from the confirmation retreat. Kinda fun. The ping-pong table that was expected mysteriously vanished, but the pool table was still there and we had fun there. I kept all my stuff in the ceiling until Seth told me to take it down because "that rarely ends well" (but it was about time to get packed anyway!). It took me almost a day to really realize how absurd it was that all my stuff was in the ceiling, since I was on the top bunk and it seemed the most natural to get my stuff by pushing up a ceiling tile, after all.

<span class="PreProc" id="152">@152.</span> I'm sitting in study hall the day before Thanksgiving with homework still to do, but I can't do it. Which brings me to...

<span class="PreProc" id="153">@153.</span> My study hall supervisor wouldn't let me go to my locker because I forgot my math book. That normally wouldn't make me mad--maybe a bit frustrated because I couldn't do my homework, but that's it, since it was, after all, my fault--except that he let someone else go earlier who had done the exact same thing. I'm pretty sure he was just frustrated that several people did it, especially since he's always let people go before.

<span class="PreProc" id="160">@160.</span> Three Microsoft engineers and three Apple engineers are taking a train to a conference together. When they go to the ticket window, the Microsoft engineers buy a ticket each, and the Apple engineers buy only one ticket among the three of them. "How are three people going to travel on one ticket?" the Microsoft engineers ask. "Watch and you'll see," say the Apple engineers. So they get on the train, and the Apple engineers squeeze into a bathroom. The train starts moving, and the conductor comes down the train, bangs on the door of the bathroom where the Apple engineers are hiding, and says, "Ticket, please!" One of the Apple engineers opens the door a crack and hands the conductor the ticket.

The Microsoft engineers are watching this and think it's a pretty good idea, so, as usual, they decide to copy it on the way back. However, this time, the Apple engineers skip buying tickets entirely. "How are three people going to travel without a ticket?" ask the Microsoft engineers. "Watch and you'll see," say the Apple engineers. So they get on the train, the Microsoft engineers go into a bathroom, and the Apple engineers go into another bathroom further down the train. Shortly after the train starts moving, one of the Apple engineers comes out of the bathroom, walks down the train, knocks on the door of the bathroom where the Microsoft engineers are hiding, and says, "Ticket, please!"

<span class="PreProc" id="225">@225.</span> The conversation after I played my solo at ISSMA last year:
<span class="Comment">Judge:</span> "Have you grown a lot lately?"

Huh?

<span class="Comment">Me:</span> "...I...guess so."
<span class="Comment">Judge:</span> "Well, that's not a full-size violin, is it?"
<span class="Comment">Me:</span> "Umm, I'm...pretty sure it is."
<span class="Comment">Judge:</span> "Well, I guess it must be a slightly smaller full-size violin than normal."

And before I played:

(Soren tunes his violin)
<span class="Comment">Judge:</span> "Make that E a little higher."

(Although it's in tune, I do so.)

<span class="Comment">Judge:</span> "Let me see that."

(I hand her my violin. She tunes it nearly a half-step sharp.)

<span class="Comment">Judge:</span> "There."

(I glance at my orchestra director, who is accompanying me, and he shrugs.)

<span class="Comment">Judge:</span> "Whenever you're ready."

My comments sheet includes the remark on Intonation: "Always make sure your E-string is in tune before playing" and a half point off.
What's worse is that this lady somehow got back judging ensembles the next year.

<span class="PreProc" id="260">@260.</span> Downloaded an archive of mrivan's NetHack ttyrecs. He is quite well-known for running a streak of 23 consecutive ascensions. As far as I know, he's been beaten only by Adeon with 28? ascensions in a row. I don't like his playstyle that much, but it's cool to watch.

<span class="PreProc" id="263">@263.</span> The internet is messed up. I wonder if there's something wrong with our DNS server, because it always freezes on the "looking up" stage. The strangest thing is that the internet light on the router is on.

<span class="PreProc" id="273">@273.</span> I know I'm kinda out of the groove, but I honestly don't know whether iPads are actually available for purchase yet. Some people have said they are, but I'd think I'd have heard a bit more about it if they were.

<span class="PreProc" id="297">@297.</span> We were taking a test on Edline (our online grading system) in the computer lab the other day. There was a sub supervising the test. I started up the computer, opened Edline, took the test, scrolled back up to the top and double-checked my answers, then hit submit. I went back to the home page of Edline, and, having nothing more to do, pulled out a book and started reading. After I had read about a page, the sub came up behind me (so I could barely even see him) and said loudly, in an I-can't-believe-you-would-try-to-pull-that-one tone, "I'm going to have to ask you to put that away." I was surprised because I hadn't seen him coming and rather confused. (As if I would be cheating by reading answers out of a novel!) I said, "Well, I'm done with the test." He walked away and said "Oh, are you?" I was actually quite annoyed that he didn't apologize.

<span class="PreProc" id="416">@416.</span> I was at a friend's house one day when his mom came in and told us about a scam where you are social engineered into dialing a number beginning with 809, and you're then charged an absurd amount of money. I had never heard of this before, and wanted to find out if it was really true (later on I found out that it is), so I headed to Google and started typing in "809". His mom yelled "Oh no you don't!" at me and started backspacing my search. Uhuh--because you can dial a number and get charged by searching the web.

<span class="PreProc" id="436">@436.</span> Our precalculus book, like most math books, has the answers to the odd problems in the back. In one case, an odd problem gave a very similar answer to an even one, and the book fixed this problem by writing on the answer to number 29, "See number 28." (I guess they think everyone has tele-and-X-ray-vision to see the full answer key on the teacher's desk.)

<span class="PreProc" id="874">@874.</span> Around 2001, our family got a new desktop computer from a popular computer company. We also got an inkjet printer in a sort of bundle deal. After a few weeks of flawless operation, the printer ceased working and made an odd clicking sound whenever a document was sent to it. We called customer support for help.

The customer support associate went through an idiotic troubleshooting checklist ("Is the printer plugged into the wall?" and so forth) and then had us check the device manager and reinstall the printer drivers. I told him it did not appear to be a software problem, because the printer was making odd noises, which indicated a mechanical failure of some kind. After an hour long session of troubleshooting, we were advised to box up the computer and printer and send it to their repair center. Yes, not just the printer but the computer as well.

They asked if we had any files on the hard drive that we'd like to save. We told them which files and folders to save for us. Finally we got the computer back and a new printer. The computer had been wiped and the operating system reinstalled, and we got our data files on a CD.

The problem? A cheeto had fallen into the printer and jammed it. They sent the cheeto back in a small plastic bag. The printer was covered by the warranty, but the CD backup was not, so they charged us $100 for it.

He didn't stop. He didn't go tell someone he hit the stop sign. He didn't get out and move the sign back to where it was supposed to go. He just backed up, drove around it, and parked.

While rather boring, the rules in the front of the student handbook have a few gems. I've included page numbers if you have yours and want to see for yourself.

#10: Bus Transportation Regulations (p. 8): "Pupils should not throw rocks, snowballs, or any other material at the school buses before entering or after alighting from buses."
(Really guys?)

#9: Sales (p. 18): "Students who accept items to sell for the purpose of gaining revenue for a school organization are responsible for returning the items or the monetary value of them."
(Why should I have to give the school the money I got from selling school property?)

#8: Skateboards: (p. 18): "Therefore, skateboards and roller blades should not be brought to school without the prior consent of the principal..."
(I wonder what kind of excuse you need to give Mr. Doane to bring a skateboard in.)

#7: Work Permits And Attendance (p. 20): "A work permit will not be issued to a student who, in the opinion of the administration, is excessively absent from school..."
(Because that's such a subjective thing.)

#6: Electronic Devices (p. 11): "If these [electronic] devices are used or visible during class time or disrupt the educational process, the student may face disciplinary consequences. Violation of this policy can result in discipline up to an [sic] including suspension or expulsion and notification of law enforcement authorities."
(I wish I could arrest people whose phone rang while I was presenting.)

#5: Bus Transportation Regulations (p. 8): "Pupils shall not enter or leave the bus until it has come to a full stop and the driver has opened the door."
(What!? No climbing out the window of a moving school bus?)

#4: School Related Events (p. 37): "There shall be no peculiar or unusual conduct permitted during the event."

#3: Driving And Parking (p. 10): "Once students enter the parking lot, the car is to be parked."
(There are many other things I like to do in parking lots, like driving around aimlessly in circles and going back out in order to come in again.)

#2: School Closings (p. 18): "School is seldom closed for inclement weather."
(In your dreams, Dr. Melin.)

#1: Student Discipline Infractions (p. 46): "[Student discipline infractions include] throwing or propelling any object. Permitted athletic activities shall not constitute a violation of this provision."

<span class="PreProc" id="1393">@1393.</span> GOLDEN RULES FOR ENSEMBLE PLAYING (by J.W. Swing)
1. Everyone should play the same piece.
2. Stop at every repeat sign and discuss in detail whether to take the repeat or not. The audience will love this a lot!
3. If you play a wrong note, give a nasty look to one of your partners.
4. Keep your fingering chart handy. You can always catch up with the others.
5. Carefully tune your instrument before playing. That way you can play out of tune all night with a clear conscience.
6. Take your time turning pages.
7. The right note at the wrong time is a wrong note (and vice versa).
8. If everyone gets lost except you, follow those who get lost.
9. Strive to get the maximum NPS (note per second). That way you gain the admiration of the incompetent.
10. Markings for slurs, dynamics and ornaments should not be observed. They are only there to embellish the score.
11. If a passage is difficult, slow down. If it's easy, speed it up. Everything will work itself out in the end.
12. If you are completely lost, stop everyone and say, "I think we should tune."
13. Happy are those who have not perfect pitch, for the kingdom of music is theirs.
14. If the ensemble has to stop because of you, explain in detail why you got lost. Everyone will be very interested.
15. A true interpretation is realized when there remains not one note of the original.
16. When everyone else has finished playing, you should not play any notes you have left.
17. A wrong note played timidly is a wrong note. A wrong note played with authority is an interpretation.

First she didn't believe that the word bank was simply missing from the quiz (this was our eighteenth vocab quiz of the exact same format, and we've always had a word bank) and didn't let us put it up, thus wasting massive amounts of time. After the vocab quiz, which should have taken about ten minutes but instead took forty, we started trying to watch a video about Pearl Harbor, it being December 7th. Instead the VCR came on to a video of cat birthing. (It must have been at the end of the tape before whatever else was on it started being taped. Mr. G said he got it from a student, so who knows where that tape has been.) We watched this twice after she rewound and started playing it AGAIN. (She complained and was saying "this is weird" the whole time but never actually stopped it.) When we finally managed to get the video going (it was in fact a DVD, not a VHS tape), it came on to a sex scene instead of actual footage of the attack, and she once again complained and was like "this is awkward" but didn't change it, nor did she fast forward to the appropriate scene.

Basically, we had to redo the entire class period the next day.

<span class="PreProc" id="1883">@1883.</span> We were making rules for the pumpkin drop lab in physics. Mr. Hefner mentioned that one year they had made a rule that everything had to be recyclable, so somebody suggested that everything should have to be <span class="Formatted">*not*</span> recyclable. This quickly led to the rule (written on the board like the rest of the serious ones): "heavy metals only."

<span class="PreProc" id="1884">@1884.</span> After I use the cafeteria restroom, I notice that there's no trash can. Holding some wet paper towel in my hand, I check by the paper towel dispenser, around corners, and under the sinks. No trash can. So I figure it must have migrated into the entryway or even the hallway. Nope, no trash can. (There are paper towels all over the floor as a result, of course.)

I throw the paper away in the cafeteria trash can, then approach the two janitors, who are swapping trash bags.
<span class="Comment">Me:</span> "There's no trash can in the bathroom."
<span class="Comment">Him:</span> "The boys'?"
(Yeah, because I would've been in the girls' and come out to report that there was no trash can. No duh. Strangely, this is something that people often do in this situation--it's like they somehow need the clarification for something.)
<span class="Comment">Me:</span> "Yeah."

They then proceed to tell me that it <span class="Formatted">*is*</span> there--even after I go back to double-check. Finally the lady grudgingly goes over to check--I apologized but didn't really have anything to apologize for, as I was just trying to limit the mess on the floor.

<span class="PreProc" id="2086">@2086.</span> I finished my AP Stats course yesterday. I only got a 73% on the final, but I passed. :-) I think I could have done better on the final if getting a higher grade had been life or death (or if I couldn't retake it if I didn't make the threshold). Matter of fact, that holds for the course in general--the way it was set up served to really decrease motivation. All in all I think the course certainly taught me some good introductory statistics, but I would have learned more in a real class. Maybe if I was better at required independent study (independent study on my own on things I'm just sort of interested in has historically gone fairly well, like <span class="Formatted">*ahem*</span> computers), I could have gotten more out of it.

Anyway, I think I'll kind of miss the course, actually: Mr. Leahy was pretty cool, and the classroom was actually a fairly nice place to spend an afternoon. It's sort of too bad there's nothing else I can take there. I'm trying to decide how I should use that extra time. I'd like to make sure it doesn't blend into other time and get wasted. I might try to practice when I get home or near it.

<span class="PreProc" id="2136">@2136.</span> Mr. Kopf told us about the time he was playing Beethoven's 3rd symphony (Eroica). The first movement is crazy long and somewhat exhausting, and when they'd finished the conductor just sort of leaned over his stand and stayed there like he was having a heart attack or something. They started playing the next movement anyway (a funeral march!), because that seemed like kind of what you have to do. They were horribly scared that he was going to die during the funeral march.

* Acheson's Rule: A memorandum is written not to inform the reader but to protect the writer.
* Boren's Laws: When in doubt, mumble. When in trouble, delegate. When in charge, ponder.
* Chapman's Rules of Committees: Never arrive on time, or you will be stamped a beginner. Don't say anything until the meeting is half over; this stamps you as being wise. Be as vague as possible; this prevents irritating others. When in doubt, suggest that a subcommittee be appointed.
* Meskimen's Law: There's never time to do it right but always time to do it over.
* Murphy's Law: If anything can go wrong, it will.
* O'Toole's Corollary to Murphy's Law: Murphy was an optimist.
* Parkinson's First Law: Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
* Parkinson's Second Law: Expenditure rises to meet income.
* Peter Principle: In every hierarchy, each employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence; thus, every post tends to be filled by an incompetent employee.
* Robertson's Rule: The more directives you issue to solve a problem, the worse it gets.
* Smith's Principle: Never do anything for the first time.

Therefore, there is no legitimate public need for you to be required to confess to a crime that the government does not know about. As a general rule, if no one has reported the crime, chances are good that no one was actually harmed by it, which means that prosecuting the offending person would be a waste of taxpayer resources that would detract from the ability to prosecute serious crime."

<span class="PreProc" id="2442">@2442.</span> So I got a call from "Windows." Apparently my system was "filled with nasty viruses" that were "eating [my] computer, sir, day by day." I kept the guy (or, the four people I was transferred to throughout the course of the call) on the phone for 32 minutes.

The only mistake I made was at the end, when I decided they would soon give up because we were on the third piece of remote control software that didn't work (I didn't even have to do anything to make the first two not work, they just didn't) so, upon downloading the third, I decided to say my computer "rebooted by itself." For some reason, instead of faking my system rebooting, I decided to cut the power switch and then turn it back on, which had the effect of corrupting the hard disk and legitimately making the system unbootable. Oops. Needless to say the call wasn't so funny after that.

Fortunately fsck recovered the disk, so all is well and hopefully one less person got scammed during the time we wasted.

* 1567: Hans Steininger, the burgomaster of Brunau, Austria, died when he broke his neck by tripping over his own beard. The beard, which was 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) long at the time, was usually kept rolled up in a leather pouch.
* 1794: John Kendrick, an American sea captain and explorer, was killed in the Hawaiian Islands when a British ship mistakenly used a loaded cannon to fire a salute to Kendrick's vessel.
* 1871: Clement Vallandigham, a lawyer and Ohio politician, was demonstrating how a victim may possibly have shot himself while drawing a weapon from a kneeling position when he shot himself in the process. Though the defendant, Thomas McGehan, was ultimately cleared, Vallandigham died from his wound.
* 1920: Ray "Chappie" Chapman, shortstop for the Cleveland Indians baseball team, was killed when a submarine ball thrown by Carl Mays hit him in the temple. Chapman collapsed at the plate, and died about 12 hours later. He remains the only major league baseball player killed by a pitched ball.
* 1993: Garry Hoy, a 38-year-old lawyer in Toronto, fell to his death on July 9, 1993, after he threw himself against a window on the 24th floor of the Toronto-Dominion Centre in an attempt to prove to a group of visitors that the glass was "unbreakable," a demonstration he had done many times before. The glass did not break, but popped out of the window frame.
* 2007: Humberto Hernandez, a 24-year-old Oakland, California resident, was killed after being struck in the face by an airborne fire hydrant while walking. A passing car had struck the fire hydrant and the water pressure shot the hydrant at Hernandez with enough force to kill him.
* 2010: Jimi Heselden, British owner of the Segway motorized scooter company, was killed when he accidentally drove off a cliff on a Segway at his estate at Thorp Arch near Boston Spa.
* 2010: 20 crew and passengers died in a plane crash near Bandundu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, when a crocodile, being smuggled by one of the passengers in a sports bag, freed itself and panicked the passengers who all ran towards the flightdeck. The tiny Filair L-410 Turbolet became unbalanced and crashed, despite the lack of any technical failure. One passenger and the crocodile survived.

While such a conversion safety has never been scored by the defense, it is the only possible way in which a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.

Since I was about four, I've noticed that cursors always go completely off two of the edges of monitors so that you can no longer see them, but stubbornly stay on two others. (They go off the right and bottom but stick on the left and top--try it.) I finally realized why: Since the point is at the upper-left-hand corner of the cursor, for the left and top sides, when that tip of the cursor touches the edge, you've reached the edge of the clickable region, so there's no reason to make the cursor go further. But on the other sides, if the system didn't let the cursor go off the screen, there would be stuff on the edges you couldn't click. (If you move the cursor all the way into the lower-right-hand corner of the screen and look very carefully, you should <span class="Formatted">*just*</span> be able to see the point there.)

It was pretty easy, then, to locate the one backpack sitting between our two tables and put my ear up to it right before the timer sounded, and sure enough, it was coming from there. Although I'm not a huge fan of going through other people's stuff, I opened up the backpack and found a phone that had a new message and felt it had to make a loud noise informing everyone on the fourth floor of the library of this fact thirty times an hour. There was an "ignore" button, which I pressed, and...silence. (I'd gone to lunch when the person came back; I hope she didn't think someone had stolen stuff from or searched her backpack. And I say 'she' because I had seen her come in earlier.)

Additionally, the medieval concept of time was that of a spiral continuously growing upwards, the assumption being that history repeats itself, albeit never in precisely the same manner. Within the spiralling form it is possible to look both forwards or backwards along a curve and view the course of events almost horizontally (or as a continuous ring), or follow certain points from one curve to another, vertically. This results in the past being remarkably close to the present.

It's funny, I feel like there'd be a U-shaped graph if you were to plot "amount of knowledge someone has" against "acceptability of saying 'I don't know.'"

People with very little knowledge are usually okay saying they don't know. People with a lot amount of knowledge are typically more secure with what they know, and are willing to admit when they don't. The dangerous ones are the ones in the middle. My experience is that the people who are willing to overcome that insecurity and keep asking questions will push through to become experts, and those that are too scared to admit their ignorance will put up a bigger and bigger front, never growing in their abilities.

A lot of that last group become the infamously inept middle managers that people joke about.

<span class="PreProc" id="3587">@3587.</span> Thought that there are two kinds of abbreviation, syntactic and semantic. Syntactic abbreviation is writing the same word or morpheme in a shorter way, like "p." instead of "page", or like Speedwords taken in an English shorthand style. (The words known in the latter have a tendency to creep into and change one's way of writing if writing from one's head, at least for me, but let's assume transcribing already-written text.) Semantic abbreviation is writing things in a different way and leaving out words. So a semantic abbreviation of the previous sentence could be "Semantic -- <span class="Formatted">_differently_</span> (fewer/different words)." Of course in all likelihood you'd combine them ("Semantic -- <span class="Formatted">_diff._</span> (&lt;/diff. words)")

I'm not sure exactly why this theory is important except that maybe there's a difference in the intelligibility of the two types either to others vs. oneself or over time. Or something of the kind. Thought I should explain it while I was thinking about it though.

First off, they're single-person bathrooms, but they're men's and women's on alternating floors. You'd think it would be more efficient just to make them all unisex. Then, inside each one, there is a single stall and a sink (no urinals in the men's). The (accessible) stall takes up more than half of the bathroom space, with the remainder being just barely enough to access the sink and still swing the door open. As a matter of fact, though it's an "accessible"-sized stall, I have quite some doubt that a person in a wheelchair would actually fit in the part of the bathroom that's not the stall in order to get <span class="Formatted">*into*</span> it. I cannot fathom why they have the stall there in the first place; the only thing I could think of would be that it could slightly increase efficiency by letting one person wash his or her hands while someone else started using the toilet, but there isn't enough space in the rest of the bathroom for anyone to wait, so you wouldn't actually know when the first person was done.

A co-worker (not an intern) was editing a perl script in production (at the time, we didn't have any other way to work on the system we'd inherited) and he removed a line in some perl code that said to print "PIG7" to the console. All that does is print the string PIG7 to the console on the machine it was running on, which should not matter to any code. Lines like that are usually used for debugging.

When he saved the file 15 minutes later, after making a few other modifications, the whole system came to a crashing halt. We're talking thousands of porn sites that were no longer making money.

It took us about an hour and a half, as we reverted change after change, [to figure out] that the PIG7 line was the key. It turns out that at some point in its history, somebody had use the output to the console as a trigger for another essential piece of code that had to run in order for everything to work. The entire operation hinged on that one little PIG7 string on the console.

Since that day, I refer to any narrow point of failure in a system, as a PIG7.

(Can anyone think of a dumber architecture than passing data between two web-server processes by printing it on the console?)

<span class="PreProc" id="3831">@3831.</span> Remembering a news article I ran into a while back in which a university decided to do an audit of all their servers and network equipment, having not done so for a few years. When the network had been scanned and mapped, they realized there was one server that wasn't in any of their server rooms and they couldn't physically locate at all. After an extended investigation, they resorted to physically following the ethernet cable back from the switch, to discover that, during a renovation of the building it was located in, the construction guys had drywalled it in--still plugged in and connected to network and running normally. It had been in that state for several years already when they found it.

<span class="PreProc" id="3832">@3832.</span> So I think I forgot to tell this story anywhere. I was out walking in the Natural Lands during finals.

I just replaced the plastic where it had been before and went on my merry way, but that was a rather strange thing to find out there. (Everyone I've told this story to has now asked if they were caf spoons; I must confess that I didn't look closely enough to know, nor do I really have a good working model of what the caf spoons look like--I just pick them up and eat with them without really looking at them.)

<span class="PreProc" id="3834">@3834.</span> I think I forgot to tell this story: Phin and Perrin both bought "new Core i7" processors on eBay for $100, from a seller in China who had zero ratings.

This comic has some level of strange loop-ness/at least infinite recursion embedded in it. I was thinking about how if you want to share it with anybody, you ought to mention the fact that it contains a spoiler and you shouldn't read it if you haven't read <span class="Formatted">_Anna Karenina_</span> yet. But then you're <span class="Formatted">*giving*</span> a spoiler by trying to prevent a spoiler... (Time for a spoiler alert on that?)

One way to look at it, perhaps: making sure you can prevent the spoiling of one results in the potential spoiling of the other. (If you make sure that it's safe to show someone the comic, you spoil the comic. If you don't, you spoil <span class="Formatted">_Anna Karenina_</span>.) So maybe it's almost some sort of quantum state, although in this case there is the out made possible by human memory and relationships of finding out if someone has read it by other means, or asking them and then waiting a couple of days.

Come to think of it, regardless of the fact that it's funny and clever, I don't think I would have created a comic like that, because of how many innocent people you're likely going to spoil. At least for a book that I care about as much as that one.

<span class="PreProc" id="3950">@3950.</span> Reasons Not to Marry Your Parent, <a href="#1">#1</a>,000,005: Really screwed-up relationships with other members of your family.
This assumes that -- hypothetically, hopefully -- you are a man and have married your mother; every gendered term except the stepfather one (which has to be the opposite of the parent you married) can go either way. Effects:
- Your entire family becomes your in-laws.
- If you have a child, you are also stepsiblings with your child.
- You become your own stepfather (and your own stepson).
- Every other relationship changes too: niece-&gt;granddaughter-in-law, father-&gt;brother-in-law, aunt-&gt;sister-in-law, cousin-&gt;nephew-in-law, grandmother-&gt;mother-in-law.
- None of this changes the relationships you already have, so you end up being related to everyone in your family in two different ways.

I haven't worked it out, but I suspect you could similarly become your own grandfather if you married your grandmother.

People still interested in incestuous relationships will be happy to know that <a href="#1">#1</a>,000,005 isn't a concern if you marry your sibling, since your sibling is related to everyone in the same way as you and all the new relationships will overlap perfectly (theoretically shadowed by another set suffixed with "-in-law").

<span class="PreProc" id="4032">@4032.</span> Watching a segment of a recent Seekers concert. Between sets, Judith is telling a story about a time someone came up to her with an album cover they wanted her to sign--but it was a Peter, Paul &amp; Mary album.

I'm amused by thinking of the possibilities for how this could have happened. So far, I've come up with:
- The person was purposefully messing around wanting to see what Judith would do. This isn't out of the question and does explain it well, but seems like an odd thing to do unless it's become some sort of meme.
- The person was at the concert, thought they wanted to get an autograph, just happened to have this album with them, and got it signed, knowing it wasn't actually the right one. This seems rather unlikely, as most people would have given her a scrap of paper rather than gotten the <span class="Formatted">*wrong*</span> thing autographed.
- The person had been running late for the concert and thought as they were leaving, "Hmm, I should try to get someone to sign my album cover" and accidentally grabbed the wrong one off the shelf. In this scenario, the person never even realized that it wasn't a Seekers album. This is probably the most likely and would probably make for the best story for that person in the end, even if it's not the funniest for us. (Actually, regardless of the story, it would be way cooler to have something that Judith signed "Mary" than anything she signed with her own name!)
- The person somehow actually mistook Judith for Mary Travers, perhaps having been somewhat flustered and excited by actually meeting her. (Both 60's folk singers with great voices, but beyond that...really nothing at all in common.)
- The person somehow came to an entire Seekers concert thinking it was Peter, Paul and Mary. This is probably not the case, but I rather like to think it is.

Whatever the case, not to be thrown off, she took it, signed it "Mary," and gave it back.

<span class="PreProc" id="4069">@4069.</span> So Grandpa Bjornstad was in Norway for a month this summer. One of the things he did was go on an extended hike. One of the relatives he'd been staying with for a while, however, was quite worried about him and made him take a blood-pressure test before going and promise to call them every day. The blood-pressure test was fine, of course, and apparently cell service is generally very good in Norway, and he has a dumb phone with great battery life, so no problem.

The first night everything is fine. The second night he can connect to a tower but can't seem to get a call through; he tries a couple of times, but no dice. Oh well, he'll just call the next night. The next night there's no service at all. The next night there's <span class="Formatted">*also*</span> no service.

The following day he comes into a shelter for the night. While they're eating, a huge dual-rotor rescue helicopter lands next to the shelter and a guy comes in with a picture of Grandpa and asks if anyone's seen him.

Yes, they've had not only the police with dogs but also the navy, the air force, and the Red Cross out looking for him for the last couple of days, because his cell phone wasn't working. One issue was apparently that he neglected to sign the logbooks along the way, because in America those are just for fun and aren't really used for anything except for ending up in some archive somewhere, but apparently in Norway they expect people to sign them, and when the first responders walked up the trail checking the logbooks and didn't find him they got worried.

Still, it's rather worrying that all those rescue people searching for two days didn't see a guy who was hiking normally on the freaking trail the entire time. It's a good thing that they didn't charge him the bill for his "rescue," though, which apparently some eastern U.S. states have now started doing (although in those cases it did involve people who legitimately needed rescuing).

It's also a very good story.

Of course he did...it was about some romantic encounter he'd had with this Greek girl, but it wasn't anything particularly bad.

I'm considering whether it might be a good idea to break RT into a new file at the five-year mark, simply because a 1MB text file starts to make the text editor run a little bit sluggishly. It's super-nice to have everything together and know a search within the file will find anything, but it is frankly beginning to get annoying. Two files would not be a huge burden, though -- maybe I could keep an "archive" file and a "current" file and, if I needed further splits, just keep appending to the "archive" file.

Then I filled out the ballot carefully. While on the last three offices, in which I was specifying that I wanted the one person listed rather than a write-in, I accidentally filled in both "write-in" and the candidate. Naturally, this made the entire ballot invalid, so I had to fill out the whole stupid thing again (repeatedly filling in little ovals is not too much fun anyway, and doing it <span class="Formatted">*twice*</span> is definitely not fun). I also had to balance rushing (because I had a meeting with Dr. May right afterwards) with not rushing so I wouldn't spoil the whole thing again.

<span class="PreProc" id="4495">@4495.</span> When I talked to Grandpa for a few minutes after the Basilica concert last Thursday, he was talking about how not many people around him seemed to really be singing, and he got from there onto the idea that singing -- in groups, for the everyday person -- really isn't a thing anymore, or isn't encouraged. The barbershop thing has disappeared (not recently, of course, but it was the mentality), weekly church-going isn't so much of a thing, and recently we don't even sing the national anthem together, so much that I wouldn't be surprised if some of today's children are growing up not even knowing the words. That is actually a recent change, at least its complete proliferation -- I can remember still when I was a child being asked to sing it at numerous events, but now I couldn't tell you when the last time was.

<span class="PreProc" id="4601">@4601.</span> So I went to Northfield this afternoon to pick up some food at the coop and get my hair cut, as I often do. When I got downtown after about 15 minutes (I had to work on moving quickly because I left a little bit late and I had orchestra rehearsal to get back to), I came up to one of the bridges across the river and found the road was blocked off. Was the sidewalk? The left side had a big "Sidewalk Closed" sign, but the right didn't, and the walk was clear all the way across. I went over there and saw that the plastic orange fencing stuff was on the ground, but it definitely looked intentional. Seeing no impediments (literally), I walked over to it and was about to step on when I heard in a monotone, "Hey bud." Knowing I was in a construction zone, I figured it might be about me, so I looked around for the source, which was not easy because it had been relatively quiet. Eventually I spotted a guy leaning on the open doorway of his red SUV. When he caught my eye, he said -- I kid you not -- "No." It took him another couple of seconds to add something like, "You can't go through there." There were probably about 500 politer ways to get that message across.

It's really sad that I was alone at the time, because "Hey bud, no!" would be a great inside joke.

After they finally sent them, though, I thought they probably should have said something apologizing for the issue and assuring people that something like that won't happen again, because it's kind of unprofessional and not really confidence-inspiring.

<span class="PreProc" id="4730">@4730.</span> I think I have worked out the cause of the unpleasant "warmth" of some choirs that I've discussed previously (CB23.61): there isn't enough of the tenor part. This is of course a common choir problem, which is unfortunate because it really detracts from the sound. The warmth, then, is the more prominent bass and the relative lack of mid-frequencies between there and the alto. And it sounds kind of gritty because it's not filled in.

And I had started to lose sight of the meaning of all of it, or I simply hadn't had it at the beginning. And then just suddenly it all made sense. There was the idea that we were going to do this, and that everything was absolutely, unequivocally worth it for what we could do to other people and to ourselves. Of course, it's like that now too.

We had a good laugh about the "croakee machine" after I hung up. (I mean, it does have a microphone, and it plays music, you can't argue that. So does just about every other piece of complex multimedia equipment in the world, though.) The other remaining question is what in the world she needs a karaoke machine for in a biology lecture.

<span class="PreProc" id="4758">@4758.</span> Also in IT today: A guy came in asking if we had soldering tools and electrical tape. I told him we had electrical tape but I didn't know where it was and we had soldering tools but I didn't know if we were allowed to let him use them. He then proceeded to show us what he needed them for. He pulled out a laptop power adapter that looked like it had been through some sort of torture camp: the brick was wrapped in two straps of duct tape and had hideously twisted and yucky cords coming out of both sides, one of which was frayed at the connection to the brick. He proceeded to remove the duct tape and open the brick, telling us that he'd opened it previously to repair a short (by prying it apart), then was too lazy to glue it back together, so he just duct-taped it. The problem he now wanted to fix was that the external cord had frayed and was no longer properly connected to the brick. This was the 120-volt power line, and he wanted to repair the broken and frayed connection with <span class="Formatted">*solder and electrical tape*</span>. I mean, I've done that with a pair of headphones (though I used permanent heat-shrink tubing, not electrical tape), but a <span class="Formatted">*power line*</span>?

I was polite about saying I didn't think we would be able to help him, and fortunately, by some ridiculous stroke of luck, someone at the desk (don't remember who anymore) had several spare adapters that he'd gotten for free with him in his computer bag, that happened to be the right kind, and so he just gave the guy one. Afterwards I made him give me the old one to discard it and took it and showed it to Phin and we both laughed at the idea. I thought afterwards that this would probably have been a good time to just respond to his initial request, "No."

<span class="PreProc" id="4850">@4850.</span> As I get older, I'm finding myself reminded more and more often of something Mr. Kopf told us in the summer orchestra introduction where I first touched a violin. He said that he's found there are four stages that most orchies go through. The stages consist of the thing that is keeping them in orchestra, the thing that succeeds in fighting the effort and busyness and everything that wants them out. Not everyone proceeds through them at the same rate, and maybe there are some exceptions, but all in all they are remarkably accurate. As follows (I elaborate a little bit and so may be more like 95% true to his original):

1. It's fun -- for a couple of weeks, playing an instrument is kind of cool.
2. Your parents keep you there -- you get some pressure to keep trying it until you've at least had a good shot at it and have tried it long enough to be decent.
3. Your friends keep you there -- there is some social opportunity in music, and it becomes part of your identity.
4. You love it.

He was not able to explain exactly what number four was, and now fully understanding what he means, it is I guess something that really defies explanation in ordinary terms, if you aren't yourself there. He just said that we were not there yet, and he <span class="Formatted">*asserted*</span> that, saying that students somewhere around our age often claimed to him that they were at stage four, but that they were just outright wrong. I felt I was there after a couple of years, and I was in the sense that 2 and 3 were not really major influences on me anymore, although they were there; but it was almost more of a thing that I did because I'd always done it. Not that I didn't like playing music, quite the contrary, but there wasn't a need from within me that kept me going.

I almost feel like I've reached stage four and a half now, or at certain points of my musical life now at least, when I experience a sort of overwhelming sense of divinity and beauty that contains so much of the meaning in the world. And I completely understand how offensive it would feel to have a fifth-grader come up to you and claim that his soul had been a part of that.

It was told well and really pretty funny, much more worthy of attention than the news. It involved him throwing his device (it was some sort of electric thing) out the window a really long way so that he was able to claim that it was his neighbor's, say he took so long to answer the door because he was pissed at them bothering him (he missed, as he noted in the story, the opportunity to claim that he had been having sex, because he had a friend in the room who was a girl), hide the rest of the drugs effectively, and then just give all sorts of stupid <span class="Statement">#excuses</span> that could not possibly have been convincing but were apparently enough that they couldn't officially prove he had done anything wrong well enough to write him up or charge him for it.

Cold December flies away
At the rose-red splendor.
April's crowning glory breaks
While the whole world wonders
At the holy unseen pow'r
Of the tree which bears the flow'r.
On the blessed tree
Blooms the reddest flow'r
On the tree blooms the rose,
Here in love's own garden,
Full and strong in glory.

Love the bud has come to bloom,
And the world awakens.
In the lily's purest flower
Dwells a wondrous fragrance.
And it spreads to all the earth
From the moment of its birth;
And its beauty lives,
In the flow'r it lives
In the flow'r
And it spreads in its heavenly brightness
Sweet perfume delightful.

In the hopeless time of sin
Shadows deep had fallen.
All the world lay under death,
Eyes were closed in sleeping.
But when all seemed lost in night,
Came the sun whose golden light
Gives unending joy,
O the endless joy
Of our hope, highest hope
On this Christmas morning.
Heavenly love -- Christmas love is dawning!

<span class="PreProc" id="4903">@4903.</span> Trying to learn the above well enough to sing along with Ole Choir on the recording.

Ingredients:
* 99 apples
* 4 tablespoons cinnamon
* 21 bananaleds [these are composed of a banana with a pencil lead sticking out of it]
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 21 coins
* 10 cups blueberries
* 21 yams
* 3 cups oats
* 70 tipewriters
* 2,000 drops of water
* 21 queens
* 21 princes

Instructions:
1. boilbananaleds
2. soak coins in cinnamon and vanilla extract for 5 days.
3. micorwavequeens for 1year. Cook and mush up blueberries and yams, separately.
4. boiltipewritetrs
5. Mix all of the above; salt and pepper to taste.
6. Add remaining ingredients and cook in an oven at 550 degrees for 2 minutes.

[Fun fact: given the volume of an average woman (59.42 L, according to W|A) and the power output and size of an average microwave (1000W, 1.6 cubic feet), it would consume over 240,000 kWh of power and, at 8 cents per kWh, cost $19,300 just to microwave the queens, if we're assuming all of the parts go in, which I am because the recipe doesn't say otherwise. Also, that's assuming that we can completely fill the microwave with the queen parts. Of course, all this pales in comparison to the difficulty and expense of finding and killing 21 queens to use.]

Now of course steno is way more demanding of brainpower than typing is, even if you're a poor typist, so I doubt it would be a huge influence, but it could certainly be there. When you look at the people who toggle capslock to get a capital letter (and yes, I see college students at the IT Helpdesk doing this and am usually caught between having a tough time not laughing and feeling really sorry for them because their typing skills are clearly so bad), you wonder how they manage to input thoughts without getting sidetracked by trying to press the stupid letters.

<span class="PreProc" id="5133">@5133.</span> A new thought about our Georgics/Eclogues commentary citing Milton excessively. Prof. Whitlatch is not a fan of this, thinking it off-topic. I find it kind of thought-provoking myself, sometimes; other times it really is off topic, though. But in any case, the fact that the author was able to think of that line suggests a wonderful familiarity with that work, doesn't it? It reminds me of Joseph's story (CB25.37) of the professor who had memorized the whole Aeneid and quoted a couple of pages when something reminded him of it. That's something the world absolutely needs more of.

I thought of this because, while doing the theology reading, I ran into a marginal note from last time I read Romans 5 (in GC interim) saying "Hmm, I didn't understand that before," to a phrase about sin bringing death, and I suddenly was reminded of something, and thought this was actually fairly obvious, and then recalled the line from the invocation of Paradise Lost, "brought Death into the world, and all our Woe", which was really cool -- undoubtedly we've discussed the Fall more since then, but I'd certainly like to think having internalized that line is a big part of it, and it certainly can't have hurt.

<span class="PreProc" id="5218">@5218.</span> I think that my typing has moved from working in the realm of spellings to words and their sounds. Essentially, I guess, I can think of the sound of a word in my head and type the correct letters. Of course, it's long past the <span class="Formatted">*letter*</span> level: for years I've been able to think of a word and type the word, rather than thinking that "word" requires me to press the 'w' key, then the 'o' key...I don't think it would be possible to type at 130WPM that way.

What makes me think that I've started typing on the sound level is the greatly increased prevalence of a certain type of error over about the past year. I know that typing errors are a very complicated topic, and nobody is fully aware of what exactly goes on in the typist's mind, at least not in the admittedly relatively limited literature I've read. But, in my judgment, I think there are a couple of categories of errors I make:

* There's the simple finger flub, where I aim for the right keys but press the wrong ones: I don't quite move my finger far enough to depress the key to the trigger point, so the letter is dropped; or I press a key on the other side of the keyboard slightly too early, causing a transposition; or I touch a key that I didn't intend to touch at all. While I don't think I make these errors much less than I ever have (though since I've become an expert typist, I don't make them often), the number of times the error causes a problem has been decreasing steadily as I add more and more of the common errors to my vim abbreviation dictionary. I can also typically detect by feel that the touch differed from what it was supposed to be and backspace the appropriate amount to correct the error without having to look up at the screen, if I have my eyes on copy.
* There's the kind where I type the wrong letter entirely, but I was on some level thinking about touching that letter. I think nowadays this happens mostly because I haven't fully collected my thoughts and know what I wanted to type. Or, similarly, I start typing a word that is supposed to come later in the sentence I'm thinking of. (I don't think that happens much if at all when I type from copy; it's a thinking-typing process error.)
* There's the kind where I start typing a word or common sequence of letters and then my fingers finish the word differently. For instance, at the beginning of the previous sentence, I accidentally typed "king" instead of "kind." This happens, I think, because that word is in my muscle memory and my typing is a separate "thread" from the words I'm deciding to type, so I've already dumped responsibility for typing that word into my finger-movement thread and am (perhaps undeservedly) trusting that it will end up typed out okay.

The error that I almost never made before recently, but that I now make relatively frequently, is a complete spelling error. (By frequently I don't mean anything like the scale of the other errors; perhaps a couple times a day, maybe even less. But the occurrence was essentially zero before, so it's noticeable.) It's not that I spelled the word wrong because I pressed the wrong buttons, or because I don't know how to spell the word. It's that I type something that phonetically makes sense but semantically or linguistically is completely wrong. Sometimes this takes the form of typing the wrong homophone: "their" for "there," or something stranger like "lye" for "lie". Sometimes it ends up being something that is absolutely nothing like the actual spelling of the word, and that I would never possibly say was the spelling of the word if you asked me to spell it for you even if I was tired and drunk, something like "konfidens" for "confidence."

And so that's why I conclude that I'm starting to type phonetically. I don't make a lot of these errors, and the increased fluency is almost certainly worth it, but those kind of errors don't happen if you're working from the spelling. I'm a very good speller, and I know perfectly well how the words are supposed to be spelled; it's that I'm not passing through the spelling information properly on the way to the keyboard.

I do wonder if studying computer stenography, which is a phonetic system of input, has something to do with it (I've been studying for about a year, although the seriousness of that has gone on and off and disappeared entirely for considerable periods at times). I've also noticed that I make these errors much more frequently when I'm working on Latin assignments, which definitely supports the hypothesis since Latin has a very phonetic orthography and also uses letters in somewhat different ways than English does.

Here is the list of things that went wrong with the 3D-bar diagram:

* The whole graphic is dominated by irritating background lines.
* It is not clear what the numbers at the left mean; presumably percentages, but it might also be the absolute number of participants.
* The labels at the bottom are rotated, making them hard to read. (In the real presentation that I saw, the text was rendered at a very low resolution with about 10 by 6 pixels per letter with wrong kerning, making the rotated text almost impossible to read.)
* The third dimension adds complexity to the graphic without adding information.
* The three dimensional setup makes it much harder to gauge the height of the bars correctly. Consider the "bad" bar. It the number this bar stands for more than 20 or less? While the front of the bar is below the 20 line, the back of the bar (which counts) is above.
* It is impossible to tell which numbers are represented by the bars. Thus, the bars needlessly hide the information these bars are all about.
* What do the bar heights add up to? Is it 100% or 60%?
* Does the bar for "very bad" represent 0 or 1?
* Why are the bars blue?

<span class="PreProc" id="5310">@5310.</span> This is the weirdest way someone (AOK, that is) has ever phrased my grade to me: "Your grade for the discussion is A."

<span class="PreProc" id="5311">@5311.</span> I had an idea while I was out walking tonight (novel). It's a corollary to JMG's famous post entitled "One Story," and I title it "One Theory." In turn it was based off something I read on Studebaker's blog recently, in which he stated in passing that most people who are not moral theorists are surprisingly inconsistent in their beliefs, and it seemed to me to imply that we all ought to be consistent. And for whatever reason I decided to question that assumption (<span class="Statement">cf. CB30.39</span>). <span class="Formatted">*Is*</span> it important to be consistent in one's moral beliefs, to have a single unifying theory? And I thought that perhaps really, it wasn't; what matters is that you always do what you feel ethically comfortable with (to the extent that you are sane and capable of making good decisions in that respect).

But I think in a lot of things, we have this desire to make everything fit one theory, and this leads to a dangerous and ugly and maybe even boring reductionism. It's natural to want this, I think: wouldn't it be cool, for instance, if there were a single theory that somehow explained everything in the universe? (Is this the Question to the Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything?) But combined with confirmation bias, we start twisting things around to fit a theory that really isn't cut out to explain something else. For instance, what happens when we start trying to explain objective facts with religion? We wind up insisting that the earth is flat in the face of powerful evidence to the contrary, and then we get ourselves in a real fix because we're trying to deny reality. Better to leave the religious aspects in the realm of things that are not objective fact, which is what religion is good at in the first place. Conversely, what if we like the way science helps us explain the world and we want to apply it to everything? Well, now if it can't be measured objectively, it doesn't exist.

This doesn't happen everywhere. Nobody says that Newtonian mechanics is bullshit because the theory of relativity exists and is a useful way to describe everything. Sure, Newtonian mechanics relies on certain simplifications. But it still objectively <span class="Formatted">*works*</span>, and it's a very clean and beautiful approximation to (the best approximation we have of) what's actually going on that is far more accurate than available measuring precision in all but the most unusual circumstances. If I want to know how long it's going to take me to drive 400 miles on the interstate and I have to take the time dilation caused by my travel into account, I'm probably not going to bother to figure it out. (And is it how long it takes <span class="Formatted">*me*</span> to travel, or how long the people at my destination think I took to travel it? For that matter, are our clocks the same to begin with?) If I want to write an email client, I don't try to plan everything out using the theory of circuitry. There is no "theory of computing" that will appropriately encompass everything that's going on and be a useful tool at all levels.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that a useful theory has a single purpose and it sticks to it, and intelligent people shouldn't try to apply it to places beyond where it belongs. (It might be a nice and useful exercise to play with it sometimes, but if you find yourself stretching things and making ugly concessions to get it to work, you're probably pounding in a nail with a spoon.) Good theories are like Unix utilities: do one thing and do it well, and then we use our natural creativity and associative memory to pipe them together.

<span class="PreProc" id="5328">@5328.</span> I decided today that I found an (arguably) autological line in Vergil, Aen 9.447:
    nulla dies umquam memori vos eximet aevo

Not only is it talking about Nisus and Euryalus not being forgotten, it itself is not forgotten! Of course, it's a special kind of autology, because Vergil could not have written it thusly on purpose.

I got to thinking about this because this line is written on the 9/11 memorial (in English translation, but with "Vergil" tagged in the corner). And it's rather out of context since it's...well, glorifying Nisus and Euryalus. Which isn't quite what they're going for, is it? At least that's not what <span class="Formatted">*I*</span> would be going for on a 9/11 memorial. Though I'll admit the line itself is very nice. But as I said during class, anytime you quote somebody or merely refer to their work, you necessarily must deal with the connotations associated with their work and with the context, because you can't expect people to set that aside. Making those connections is how we develop our thought and how we learn.

And who takes care of the details?

Who checks these details in today's typesetting environment? Judging by the low quality of a lot of typesetting, from the most prestigious magazines to the documents prepared in corporate offices, the answer appears to be -- nobody.

Could I bold, italicise, and underline everything and print it in yellow text on a white page? It doesn't say a "readable" or "text" font.)

Actually, you could go a long way with a "joke paper," so to speak, that followed the letter of the rules but was completely wacko. For instance, how many sets of your average paper guidelines specifically indicate what language the paper should be in? Or what size paper you need to print it on?

Annoyed, he gets up and goes and asks the bartender, "Whose monkey is that?" "It's the pianist's," says the bartender.

<span class="PreProc" id="5485">@5485.</span> In the used bookstore in Mineral Point, I found a cookbook published in 1989 by the American Heart Association on low-fat cooking. What caught my eye was the fact that it was a cookbook written by an M.D. The whole thing was really pretty hilarious (and stomach-churning, in some ways, although it wasn't all <span class="Formatted">*that*</span> bad for the most part), but these two quotes stood out:

<span class="Comment">In the introduction:</span> "The recipes in this book have been analyzed by computer."

<span class="PreProc" id="5501">@5501.</span> So I got a B+ in Abstract Algebra. I'm <span class="Formatted">*really*</span> happy about that. In a very illogical but quite understandable development, I now feel a lot better about how the class went now that I know that my grade was not a disaster (indeed, quite a bit better than I had expected). I still didn't fully understand everything in the course, but you know, maybe that doesn't have to be the point. It taught me something about doing proofs in preparation for algorithms. It gave me a very difficult class to try to wrap my head around. It taught me that there <span class="Formatted">*are*</span> such crazy and abstract and difficult things out there to struggle with if you want to. And it was something different. Maybe most of all, I think it taught me that that kind of math is not for me, but I can try to force my way through it and have some success if I try hard enough. And all that is worth something even if I can't honestly say in objective terms that I "liked" the class given how difficult it was. Although, actually, I still have to admit that (especially before we got into the more complex stuff near the end), there really were parts that I enjoyed, or at the very least found intellectually and mathematically stimulating. So all in all, I think it was a good thing for me to take. I still don't think I'll recommend taking it to people who aren't math majors; I can think it was a good thing for myself to take, but I certainly won't put any shine on the amount of difficult work and hand-wringing involved.

<span class="PreProc" id="5548">@5548.</span> I had some kind of dream last night or the night before about a kind of poetry that used some sort of concordance different than but similar to rhyme. It seemed to be related to the sort of alliteration that early English poetry used, but it involved words in specific places within the lines that matched each other in some way. It was very beautiful; it's too bad I can't remember more.

<span class="PreProc" id="5550">@5550.</span> On this Cara Dillon video on YouTube, the description text begins with "Massan and Ellie Forever." Curious what this meant, I googled it in quotation marks; there were 96 results, and when I clicked on <span class="Formatted">*any*</span> of them and did a find, nothing came up. None of them explained it or were that sort of site, either...so I guess it's just a huge mystery. It sounds cool. Nice and mysterious for something you can't figure out, I suppose.

<span class="PreProc" id="5551">@5551.</span> I've looked at this other one probably three times, and it's titled "Never in a Million Years After the Morning," which I thought was a really neat title, but wasn't sure exactly what it meant. It turns out that the song is "Never in a Million Years," and it's from the album "After the Morning," which isn't nearly as cool but makes a hell of a lot more sense.

<span class="PreProc" id="5552">@5552.</span> Reminds me of a <span class="Statement">#mondegreen</span> which I don't have in here: when I got the 24/7 album by CB&amp;S, I listened to it a couple of times before I looked at the lyrics, and I thought during that time that the title and refrain of the song "Privatize" was "private eyes," which made a little bit of sense and is a lot more fun.

In my defense, it's very difficult to tell the difference in a properly sung text, because the 't' has to attach to the 'ize' syllable regardless of which it is. Plus the accent fell largely on the third syllable (in accordance with my interpretation of the first two as an adjective) because of the line of the music.

<span class="PreProc" id="5553">@5553.</span> In the same way, when the media spouts some absurd bit of manipulative hogwash, if you take the time to think about it, you can watch your own representation shift from "that guy's having an orgasm from slurping that fizzy brown sugar water" to "that guy's being paid to pretend to have an orgasm, so somebody can try to convince me to buy that fizzy brown sugar water." If you really pay attention, it may shift again to "why am I wasting my time watching this guy pretend to get an orgasm from fizzy brown sugar water?" and may even lead you to chuck your television out a second story window into an open dumpster, as I did to the last one I ever owned. (The flash and bang when the picture tube imploded, by the way, was far more entertaining than anything that had ever appeared on the screen.)

<span class="PreProc" id="5745">@5745.</span> I was thinking recently that one of the cooler things about RP abbreviations for names (besides taking less time to write) is that they give you some different forms of the name to use stylistically. Sometimes I might want to write out a name specifically, or specifically use the abbreviation. That's a register that you don't have if you leave things unabbreviated (sadly, in English there are not many forms of names). It's a sort of personal language of added expressiveness.

Yes, you're going to learn a powerful but horrifically messy and complex language built on a language from 1970 whose primary goal is to allow users to shoot themselves in the foot. In 8 hours. After which time you'll be able to program whatever you want.

<span class="PreProc" id="5751">@5751.</span> Armstrong told us today a metaphor that KJ used for being ready to start singing your line: it's like you're next to the railroad tracks waiting for a train you're planning to jump.

<span class="PreProc" id="5752">@5752.</span> Wrote a wonderful scathing review for this terrible Ada "book" (I'm not even going to give it the honor of being called a book without scare quotes).
There are several major problems with this book:

1) The usage and style is dreadful. Here's a short passage from Chapter 3:

"After the starting letter, identifiers can contain as much numbers, underlines, and letters. Just make sure that underlines only occur once in the identifier. Also, underlines must ever be the last character in the identifier....Letter cases are not very important....However, it is imperative for an identifier to fill one text line."

There are a few places where I can't even tell what the author means, and besides, I find it very difficult to trust a book that is written so poorly and unprofessionally.

2) Though this is supposed to be a "beginner's guide," in several places technical jargon and Ada terminology is used without introduction. While I understand that this is probably not intended to be a book for learning your first programming language, I am a computer science student and have fairly extensive background in programming, and I have trouble understanding some of these paragraphs (not helped by point 1).

Things such as imports or the function Put_Line() (for displaying output on the terminal) are used in code examples without explanation. The text surrounding the code examples tells me less than the code itself, even without much familiarity with Ada's syntax.

In other places, pages are taken up on boilerplate: an entire chapter is devoted to explaining the use of the boolean comparison operators (equal to, not equal to, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to).

3) The book fails to explain the motivation behind many things; for instance, underscores can be written in numbers and will be ignored by the compiler. The purpose of this is to allow you to write thousands separators in the source code, but it doesn't explain this and leaves you to wonder why you might want to put extra characters in your code without any reason, and why the compiler would specifically be written to allow it.

4) There are no exercises whatsoever, nor does it even explain how one compiles an Ada program, which might be fine for a reference work but hardly for a book that is supposed to introduce you to the language.

This book cannot possibly have earned 4.8 stars on its own merit; while the reviews did look a little bit like empty praise, I wasn't expecting the book to be this bad. Don't waste your money, or your time.

<span class="PreProc" id="5776">@5776.</span> We had some recruiter/outreach people from Google come to OS today. I asked Papa's pet question about how possible available disk space can cope with increasing data storage volumes, and the answer I got was that disk space is still growing at a healthy exponential clip and so it simply hasn't been a problem for them yet (looking at the growth rate of big data, I still imagine it will be eventually if present trends continue -- but then those last four words are some of the most naïve and dangerous in all of statistics and economics).

Among the other questions people asked was one about whether Google uses any particular software development methodology, and the answer was no, not really, it depends on each individual project. One of the guys worked on the GUI toolkit for Android, and he said when they were first developing Android, they essentially used the "HSP -&gt; WTC -&gt; S" development methodology, which means:

<span class="PreProc" id="5777">@5777.</span> If I forget, I went to a very interesting sort-of-lecture at the Classics Conversation Table last night by Prof. Ripley in religion, where he talked about how studies of the ancient world can help inform his study of the gospel of John. One of the most interesting things he talked about was how there's often a reductionist approach to Judaism and Christianity in that time period and this notion that Christianity was emerging out of "Judaism," and these were two clearly defined forces (or even, as I might have thought previously, that Judaism was one solid thing and then some amorphous blob of Christianity started taking vague shape and was rather plural over the next while until it finally coalesced into the Catholic Church). He says no, there were actually a number of different kinds of Jewish perspectives at the time, and it's not clear who exactly John was. But this he said might help explain some of the anti-Semitism that's often read into it; I know we talked in The Biblical God last semester about how from Mark -&gt; Luke/Matthew -&gt; John things start to progressively more "blame the Jews"; Ripley suggested that rather John is probably blaming the particular brand of Judaism that insisted that people thinking a bit more freely and going a bit outside of tradition was very harmful. (And as he pointed out, there is some value in community cohesion that can come from insisting that everyone follow a certain path, and there was also history to make them want to think that. But of course it also has its downsides, like resulting in killing the Messiah. You know, pretty minor.)

My initial thought, however, was that it was simply the weight of one sheet of paper. Not only does this not make sense because the rating of the paper would then depend on how large the sheets were, it would also mean that that Master notebook, not counting the cover, would weigh over 12 kilos!

Upon this the old man gets off and let his son ride alone. The next they met called the lad a graceless, rascally young jackanaphs to ride in that manner through the dirt while his aged father trudged along on foot. And they said, the old man was a fool for suffering it. He then bid his son come down and walk with him, and they traveled on leading the ass by the halter; till they met another company, who called them a couple of senseless blockheads for going both on foot in such a dirty way when they had an empty ass with them, which they might ride upon.

    I much prefer a cuckolding to a cod-stepper was vandalously edited into one of my webpages.

Even though I couldn't entirely understand it, I took this as an insult. Unfamiliar with the phrase "cod-stepper"--and still in the dream--I attempted to look it up in the dictionary. There was a result, and it was something like this:

    cod-stepper - noun - an unwise or unsound business proposition (Ex: "I invested $20,000 in electronic bagels. What a cod-stepper that was!")

<span class="PreProc" id="6174">@6174.</span> Watched <span class="Formatted">_Inception_</span> again last night. While I didn't have a ton of trouble following it the first time a few years back, I definitely followed it better this time, which was nice -- only at the beginning was I confused about what was a dream. Rather, only at the beginning was I confused about what the <span class="Formatted">*characters*</span> thought was a dream; I have a new possible theory that to a certain extent Mal was right and the entire movie was a dream (or at least to the extent that the RL world is itself a dream), and there are many other confusing places. And I'm still bothered by the final scene. I read a review that suggested that Cobb stopped caring about whether it was a dream -- he leaves the totem still spinning on the table while he goes to hug his children and never comes back to it before the final cut -- and so it didn't matter so much. But I think it's crucial, maybe not to him at that moment, but in general, because if he is still dreaming, he will be doing exactly what Mal fell victim to, purposefully forgetting that things are not real, and that just feels wrong. That was why he ended up responsible for Mal's death: because he couldn't stand to live in the dream forever. And at the end of his time in obvious limbo, he dismissed Mal's spectre saying her dream identity simply wasn't real and complete enough for him; his children will necessarily be no different.

I keep going back and forth on whether the top was meant to fall. It starts wobbling harder, especially in the soundtrack, right before the final cut -- and this was presumably why my mind revised it to have fallen entirely the first time I saw it. It also wobbled while it was still starting, though. I guess the combination is why I like my theory about everything being a dream: it lets me believe that yes, he is back in his reality, but then throws in a little bit of doubt about whether <span class="Formatted">*that*</span> reality is any good.

My other big insight is that the main thriller plot is really secondary; at least for me, it's the Cobb &amp; Mal line that really makes the story. The goal of inception is only a means to an end, and were it not for his mistake with Mal he would never have needed to do the whole thing in the first place, he would still be at home and could have given up on the extraction peacefully.

Also, I give artistic license to all the completely ridiculous constraints that have to be put on their dream machine. IMO they become believable enough because the machine can instantaneously put you under and wake you up, so it stands to reason that the dreams produced could be somewhat different than normal ones, but it still requires a substantial amount of conscious suspension of disbelief. Come to think of it, I think that many of the people who don't like the movie just aren't able to get over that (Mama was this way, I think; IIRC she got all hung up on the fact that the dream machine "couldn't exist"). Anyway, I have a big and rather obvious suggestion for improvement of the safety of the machine, should it somehow ever actually exist: put a damn eye movement sensor on it, so if one of the dreamers signals an emergency, say eight consecutive eye movements, it triggers the timer and wakes them up. (If necessary, said person could presumably disconnect the others at that point, say Cobb for Mal. Or the timer could even wake everyone.)

Oh, and in the LD-experience category I absolutely loved the moment where the boss goes lucid because the carpet is made of the wrong fiber -- not the slightest bit unbelievable as a cause, but yet really funny as well. And of course Ariadne's first moment of awakening. I'm not sure I had exactly that experience of wonder myself, but something like it.

Someone came up to Armstrong after a concert. He was terminally ill and probably only had a few weeks. And he said something like this: "I don't know what heaven is like. But if it's anything like this, I'm ready to go."

&gt; It amazes me that most American still believe their government's official story of 9/11. Elsewhere in the world, people generally accepted the US government blew up their own buildings.

Yeah, it's not like we saw terrorists fly planes into buildings on almost-live TV or anything. And it's not like we saw the government drop a collective load when it happened, generally looking like idiots for not being able to sniff out the plot or stop them despite plenty of warning signs. It's not like we heard first-hand from very brave eyewitnesses that tried to commandeer a fourth plane that was likely destined to hit the white house or capitol building. And it's not like any terrorists organizations claimed credit for the attack.

I think the most damning bit of counter-evidence is the fact that it would require some crazy level of competence and cunning to successfully pull off the most audacious false flag operation in the history of humankind. That doesn't remotely begin to describe the federal government I know.

I mean, hell, they can't even hack into a locked iPhone.

<span class="PreProc" id="6521">@6521.</span> This was very interesting, about people getting mad at discussion sites for changing rules and stuff:
&gt; If you disagree with one there's no reason not to move on.

I can do that. You can do that. They probably can't (easily) do that. They have a vested, emotional, interest in their "internet home." Me? I've been online, in one form or another, since the mid-1980s. I've seen communities come and go. I've left more sites than I can count. It's reached the point where I don't even bother to voice my displeasure, I just wander off and stop visiting entirely one day.

I, and probably you, grew up when our site, or even the internet, weren't ubiquitous things or even consistent things. How many forums have you seen come and go? How many have you, yourself, owned? Me? Dozens... Hell, if we want to count the BBS' then... Wow... (I was leet, baby - not just one but TWO 40 MB HDDs, backups AND a spare system.)

I've got an address bar and I know how to use it. Them? They've set it as default and have spent eight hours a day there since they were 14. They've been molded by it and molded it in return. They have a sense of ownership. They have a sense of being.

Really, it's a transient thing (this internet) so they're foolish for doing so but it's how it is - I'm pretty sure.

<span class="PreProc" id="6522">@6522.</span> Really, is it so foolish? You might as well say there's no point in making friends or falling in love, because we're all going to die someday, and we might well drift apart before then. I get the point that the Internet may be even more transient than that (although I think that's debatable), but just because something might not always be around doesn't mean you shouldn't take advantage of it now, does it?

I think I can actually analyze how this one gets misheard at least on this (presumably the primary) recording. The big issue is that there's almost no sibilant on "rise" -- it's almost "rye," sounding just like a shortened "right," also sometimes followed by a literal "all right." The phrase "bad moon" is actually quite clear, but when you're trying to piece together "there's a ba--oo-- on the right," "bathroom" just feels like the answer.

<span class="PreProc" id="6697">@6697.</span> I was thinking that there's an excellent example of the Dunning-Kruger effect (aka "illusory superiority") in listening to recordings of myself, in both directions.

But then when I listened to, say, <span class="Formatted">_Pieta_</span>, I thought it was relatively poor at the time we sang it, and it's absolutely gorgeous on the recording.

A good part of the bad direction is a phenomenon which I might aptly describe as the, "Dammit, I put an 'S' in the wrong place, the whole piece is ruined!" phenomenon. Of course the piece isn't as good when someone puts an S in the wrong place, and it is actually noticeable in many cases, and maybe it is worth beating yourself up over at least a little bit if it means you'll do it less often in the future. But the thing is it really <span class="Formatted">*does*</span> feel like the entire piece is ruined when you put an S in the wrong place, and of course it really isn't.

<span class="PreProc" id="6717">@6717.</span> Just got back from the Viking/Manitou concert. They blew me away, they were absurdly good. We were <span class="Formatted">*nothing*</span> like that. Last year was nothing like that. There were a few technical slips (hell, we have those in Ole Choir), but they sang with feeling and their tone was absolutely gorgeous. It was nearly an Ole Choir-length concert, though, a few minutes past two hours.

The concert was great, but the audience was horrendous. The average age was probably about 30 higher than usual in Boe Chapel. I think a lot of Oles didn't come because it's just those first-year choirs (bad choice today, guys!). So several cell phones went off during the performance. More than one person was taking pictures with the shutter sound on full volume. A number of people were probably too sick to really be at the concert, and this is something I don't get: if you're really sick but you really want to come to a concert, and said concert is fairly casual, as this one is, then you sit in the back on the aisle. In Boe Chapel, if you sit in the back row and find you need to cough or leave for whatever reason, you can literally be outside the building in silence in under ten seconds. One old lady was sitting on the center aisle in the front row and had a huge coughing fit during a quiet piece, which ended up lasting basically the entire length of the piece as she proceeded down the side aisle, loudly, at about six inches per second, and then, reaching the back, coughed like crazy without actually going outside the narthex or closing the door. And there were others.

"Keurig agents have been sneaking into people's houses and replacing their Keurig coffeemakers with the new, fancy Keurig 10.0. However, the Keurig 10.0 is incompatible with all old 3rd party k-cups. To avoid being 'upgraded', you should leave a sign saying 'do not steal and replace' by your coffeemaker, but the Keurig agents will remove the sign sometimes so you need to make sure to keep replacing the sign if it disappears overnight. Reports have also surfaced of the Keurig agents occasionally ignoring the sign altogether, so some people recommend having someone in the house stay awake by the Keurig at all times to decline the upgrade."

"Tesla owners are facing a forced upgrade to the Tesla Model FU, which now runs on diesel. Tesla officials say that, to decline the upgrade, simply park your car facing towards Redmond when the upgrade agents come by to check. The upgrade agents can come by to check at any time, including when you're in the middle of driving."

I could go on, but do you get my point? People should not be required to be actively vigilant about keeping their equipment from suddenly having massive (and potentially ruinous) changes forced on them.

<span class="PreProc" id="6788">@6788.</span> I think the other day I worked out part of why people telling me that their dog won't bite me is so annoying. I was out walking near the Frisbee golf course and some people were playing / hanging out nearby and their dog came over and started following me. I continued walking quickly away from said dog and glancing over at the owners, and a moment later a woman called out, "He won't bite!" and called the dog back. She petted the dog and said, "Not everyone likes dogs."

Yes, because the problem is that I "don't like dogs." Well, let's be fair, I would indeed be a fool to assume that a strange dog would <span class="Formatted">*not*</span> bite me just because people aren't paying attention to what the dog is doing. But setting that entirely aside, the real problem is that I don't like random dogs I don't know following me, or dog owners being so careless that they let their dog wander off and follow strangers. Them assuming that it's somehow my dislike of their animal is really irritating.

But when evangelicals pray to God in a back-and-forth dialogue--when they go on date night and sit on a park bench with God's arm around their shoulders, when they ask God which shirt they should wear that morning or which medical school he thinks they should attend--the play frame is also and self-consciously a reality frame. They know that they are 'pretending' to talk to God. Much in the way they talk about their interaction indicates that they know that this is not 'really' God. Yet congregants also insist that the daydream-like prayer is a way of encountering God.

<span class="PreProc" id="7159">@7159.</span> So today I read a news article saying that nearly 2,000 students at some university in Ghana have submitted a petition to remove a statue of Gandhi from their campus. The reason being that Gandhi was actually a somewhat racist person. Now I did not know the extent of this, but I'm willing to believe it. And okay, he was racist toward African people when he was in South Africa. But where is this going to stop? Apparently the new rule is that for someone to be honored, they have to be perfect in every way. Maybe I should just point out that if you insist that a human being has held no views and taken no significant actions that offend anyone in any way before honoring her, we are never going to honor any person ever again. I'm not sure if the people waging these campaigns have ever tried to follow their campaign to its logical conclusion, if indeed it did succeed beyond their wildest dreams.

Maybe my point is: We should honor great things that people have done, and there is no reason that it should be impolitic to honor the people who made them happen. It's fine to make widely known that Gandhi was racist, and in fact it's good for people to know the dark sides of their heroes, if only to demonstrate that nobody is in fact perfect. It's not fine to say that Gandhi sucks and we should pretend he didn't exist except in the history books because he held some views that are repellent to most modern minds. Because he did, you know, kind of bring about India's independence non-violently, among other things.

<span class="PreProc" id="7205">@7205.</span> Random amateur linguistics theory, in response to the question of why the most common words (e.g., to be) tend to have such irregular forms. I wonder if part of the answer is that they give more information, while being easy to remember because they're so common. This goes along with the theory of gender marking that I read about recently: in languages that have grammatical gender, the genders tend to be more or less randomly assigned, because if they were not, then words that were discussed next to each other would tend to be the same gender, which would eliminate the entire benefit of being better able to distinguish between them with pronoun references. The problem with grammatical gender, of course, is that it adds a lot of complexity and sources of error, which is why many languages (particularly, I note, ones with less culturally homogeneous speakers) have tended to get rid of them or simplify the systems over time. I submit that making a very common verb irregular in a way that adds more information (for instance, in English, marking more person/number combinations with unique forms) may be an easy way to add additional information without adding significant corresponding mental load.

A scientist puts a flea on the table and shouts at it: "Jump!" And the flea jumps.

<span class="PreProc" id="7235">@7235.</span> [Having to solve your tech problems yourself] actually costs your company a lot more, then, not less.

The trick, of course, is that it's a hidden cost that is virtually impossible to tally on a spreadsheet: your productivity is lost while you fix that problem. Did it take you an hour, where a tech might have taken 10 minutes? Did it take you several days when a tech might have had it cleared up in an afternoon? Who gets paid more for their time, you or the tech? That's a cost that's really hard to quantify, and so gets completely ignored.

My favorite example of this is when I worked as a hardware depot manager for one site of a huge global corporation. IT management issued a mandate that said hardware depots could only keep X amount of stock on hand at any given time and could only order new stock when it was gone. New stock orders also required the personal approval of the <a href="#3">#3</a> guy in IT management.

I regularly went through my stock in about a week, week and a half, and it would take two weeks or more to receive a new pallet of computers to refresh my stock. Furthermore, as you might expect, the <a href="#3">#3</a> guy in IT is a pretty busy guy, so he would sometimes take up to a week to approve my stock orders.

In the end, IT saved millions globally because their stock orders were drastically reduced, yet on the local level you had engineers being paid upwards of $1000 a day to twiddle their thumb while they wait for their $500 computer to arrive. But IT doesn't see one dime of that cost. In fact, unless a department gets hit with a flood of new hires who need new computers, it's likely none of the local departments will see a big enough impact on their budget to formally complain to IT about the process. Yet the company's cost saving methods caused a $500 computer to cost upwards of $20,000, and all of it is hidden from the bean counters.

In <span class="Formatted">_The Ethics of Voting_</span>, Jason Brennan illustrates this with a fun hypothetical.

Let's say you're voting in a major national election. Brennan suggests that there are just over 122 million voters, the same number that voted in the presidential election in 2004. Brennan models a very close election -- each citizen has a 50.5% chance of voting for candidate A and a 49.5% chance of voting for candidate B. To add in a sweetener to encourage you to vote, if your candidate wins the election, you will personally receive $33 billion in benefits, far more than any individual citizen receives as a result of any real world election. How much do you think your vote is worth to you given those parameters?

Brennan did the math, and calculated that even given these parameters, your vote is only worth $4.77 X 10^-2650. That's 2,648 orders of magnitude less than the value of a penny. Indeed, even if you were to receive ten thousand million trillion dollars if your candidate won, the expected value of your vote would still be thousands of orders of magnitude below a penny.  Bear in mind, this is modelling a very close election in which you are to be awarded a fabulously unrealistic sum in the event your candidate wins. In a normal election, or worse, a normal election that will be decided by more than half a percentage point, the expected value of your vote is thousands of times smaller.
<span class="Underlined">--Ben Studebaker's blog</span>

Another nice comparison I just estimated: If instead of one election we run a trillion elections every day for the next 100 billion years (far longer than we can expect to be here), and your candidate only has to win one, we remove about 25 orders of magnitude from that figure. -2650 is <span class="Formatted">*mind-bogglingly*</span> small; there is no human way to account for all of those orders.

<span class="PreProc" id="7338">@7338.</span> I'm not sure whether to be amused or exasperated by the people berating 538 on Twitter about "being so wrong all week." You know, they did give Trump at least a 20% chance of winning the election most of the week. If someone is expected to win 80% of the time, that does mean that one in five times they will lose...

Not to say that there can't be polling and model factors in place as well, but "wrong" is a thoroughly dumb label to pin on a probabilistic statistical model without actually looking at how it was calculated.

Further, of course, sometimes models do give a generally misleading result because of methodological mistakes or imperfections, and that doesn't mean you get all pissed at the people making them. Everyone acknowledges they're educated guesswork, and you analyze why that happened so you do better in the future.

People also seem to be complaining about how the forecast kept changing over the course of the night. There's some fundamental misunderstanding here when a chance says 50%, then you get some additional information and it goes to 75%, then it goes back to 40% the other way, and you complain that the forecast is all over the place. <span class="Formatted">*All of those can be right*</span>, you're just getting more information about where in the distribution you probably are...and would you prefer that they just give one forecast and then give you no more updates ever?

I have sometimes wanted to get the technical aspects down so that I don't have to be focusing too hard on them all the time. That seems to be largely elusive and maybe impossible; even though getting things more down means I don't have to worry about them, it doesn't mean I stop thinking about them. But maybe actually there's nothing wrong with being focused on those aspects, being focused on them is actually part of being in an ultimate state of flow and connected consciousness.

<span class="PreProc" id="7650">@7650.</span> I was thinking today more about what qualifies as "user-friendly" interfaces. Specifically, I was remarking on the fact that, as I read someone say recently, it's really kind of a poor testament to human ingenuity that for over 50 years, we have not managed to find any more effective way of interacting with a computer than the Unix shell. But I think one of the primary things that distinguishes the supposedly user-unfriendly CLI from the GUI is discoverability: the (perfectly correct) idea is that it's easier to figure out how to do things you don't know how to do in a GUI, at least if it's designed well.

But then take a step back and question the assumption that this is something we should actually be able to do. Essentially, it amounts to expecting that we can use the computer without being taught how to use it, which seems kind of silly. I wouldn't expect someone to be able to work out how to ride a motorcycle without being taught how or at least without reading the manual and experimenting for quite some time. Does that mean it has a bad interface? But somehow if someone can't use my software without taking a while to learn how, people say my software is bad. Sure, discoverability is great, but when it makes the interface worse for people who know how to use the software, that's not a good tradeoff.

...When one keeps in mind that the alphanumeric string "aim-to-overthrow" might as well have been "holds-one-teaspoonful" or "bling-blang-blotch", it seems dubious that the above-quoted expression contains information that the Contras, or anyone else, ever aimed to do anything at all. In fact, even the use of the word "information" seems an exaggeration. The program has been informed of nothing -- it has merely been handed a string of letters and punctuation marks. As a result of this, no ideas will be created, no knowledge will be consulted, no imagery will be formed. Yet simply because highly evocative English words are embedded in the string, it is hard to resist this easy slide down a very slippery epistemological slope.

On the very first clove the "heavy duty" press broke. I heard one loud crack. It did however press 1/2 the clove. If that is what ekco meant when they said it was "heavy duty" then it is. I however do not think they intended it to break on the first clove. Please do not waste your money on this "heavy duty" press. You will be very happy you didnt. Off to find a real press now.

<span class="PreProc" id="8362">@8362.</span> I had the idea for a course about "computer literacy" -- but it would teach how to not be mystified by computers or frustrated out of your mind the first time you encounter software that doesn't do exactly what you want. Might even be something I could try to teach or introduce sometime, though that's getting pretty ambitious. I want to start with just thinking about what exactly it should involve. My idea for the first part of the course is to teach Excel, then turn people loose trying to use a wide variety of other spreadsheet programs (including a few weird things like Lotus 1-2-3, Teapot, etc.). Spreadsheets are great literate-computing tools already, since the whole point of the paradigm is to enable the user to easily hack some calculations together; I once saw someone claim they are one of the few truly democratizing innovations in computing ever. Then trying to apply the knowledge to something quite similar would boost confidence and teach a lot of self-figuring-stuff-out skills.

Later on there would be some basic Python, since it's an easy language and fantastic for throwing something together, and somewhere along the line some knowledge of how computer internals work. Obviously this would have to be the equivalent of several college courses, probably either two or three. But I think you could get somewhere much improved with a relatively moderate amount of work.

Once a wealthy merchant stopped in a small village for the night and was taken in by a couple who lived in a small hut made of thatch. Although they were poor, he was impressed by their kindness and hospitality, and before he left the next morning, he gave them an ornate throne.

The throne looked rather out of place in their hut, so they decided to keep it in the attic and decide what to do with it later. Unfortunately, a few weeks later it fell through the ceiling onto their bed during the night and crushed them to death.

The moral of the story is, people who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.

My windows are "reinforced" like this. When we bought my condo unit we got a security system installed. We saw they had a "glass break" option for the windows and asked if we could get that too. The guy took one look at us, one look at the window and laughed "planning to have any cars coming through the windows??". We laughed but he was like "hah no seriously it will take a car to break the glass" we still got it anyway like dweebs.

Last fall Hurricane Matthew came through. Amongst other thing a giant planter was hoisted into a neighbor's window and not even a scuff. One poor girl left her window unlocked though and it tore open and off (swinging window) and it fell three stories to the ground. It broke the CONCRETE stairs it landed on and it chipped the sidewalk it landed on, but the glass, while partially shattered, was still intact and impossible to get through still.

I am an Apple fan. I am under no impression that most things they do are at all innovative. What they do, however, is implement things very well that are sometimes half-assed on other platforms.

The reason I really enjoy my Apple devices isn't because they do anything that I can't do on other platforms, it's because things work consistently the way I'd expect, every time. If I want to hack things or run random binaries and experiment around with unproven technologies, I'll do it on my PC.

When I need an appliance that operates as expected when I need it to, it's Apple all the way. I know that isn't what you want to hear, but it's the truth.

"The situation was that I was calling a function repeatedly and somehow the values returned by each call were <span class="Formatted">*automatically*</span> accumulating (which was what I wanted, but I expected that I would have to, you know, actually add up the return values). Turns out I neglected to initialize the counter variable in the function, and every time the function restarted, the stack frame would be in exactly the same place and it would cheerfully resume incrementing the exact same memory locations."

(The other part was that earlier I had done a calloc() of a larger area of memory than I strictly needed, and this caused the relevant portion of memory where the counters were held to be reliably initialized to zero every time.)

I would actually argue differently.

In the Latin language, there is a word "data" which is a plural noun, the plural of "datum".

However, in the English language, the word "data" is a mass noun, like "spaghetti" or "information" or "mud", and is actually not the plural of "datum"!

That might raise eyebrows, but I really mean it! The word "data" is a very common word in English, but the word "datum" is not. I talk about data all the time, but I would never say "Take a look at this datum."

In fact, I'm not even sure what a "datum" is. If I give you a fact like "Michael Jackson died in 2009", is the entire sentence just one datum? Or is his name one datum, and the year is another datum?

Like, the carrier's sole job is to get your package to its destination safely, they have no other job you're paying them for. I understand that having insurance and no insurance allows prices to be lower for people who are only shipping cheap items or ship at high volume and can take a small loss now and then, but can you imagine if the same model were used in other service industries?

Like, say if I took my car in to be detailed and washed, and I got this: "All right sir, you can get the normal detail for $150, or you can get the insured detail for $155. For $150 there's a 1 in 200 chance we won't actually clean your car and we'll return it to you dirty, but we'll still charge you. For $155 we'll refund your money if we don't clean your car."

Why you should, in fact, try to do something about climate change and environmental damage. (Executive summary in first paragraph.)

I recently ran into a <span class="Formatted">_Guardian_</span> article asserting that we should be seeking collective, rather than individual, solutions to our environmental problems, because individual solutions accomplish nothing (link at end). Many people believe this themselves: "My contribution to the issue is so small, there's nothing I can do about it by myself." There is certainly some truth to this; reducing your carbon footprint, for example, will indeed do practically nothing to the world's carbon footprint. But there are two huge problems with this attitude: it is incompatible with our everyday sense of morality, and it fails to account for the absolute necessity of individual action in provoking collective action.

Before I begin, let me note that I don't want to discount all of the message of the original article I'm partially responding to. Corporate greed is a real part of our environmental problems, and large-scale responses reasonably must involve the government somewhere. Collective action is necessary. The problem is that individual action is also necessary, and the article discounts this entirely.

Let's start by looking at what collective action on environmental issues has accomplished thus far and why it has failed to accomplish more. Pick your favorite issue: climate change, resource depletion, pollution, acidification of the oceans, mass extinction, whatever. As long as there is no straightforward solution, like banning the use of DDT or CFCs and replacing them with other substances that do precisely the same thing without the same environmental damage, there is really only one issue: we have to substantially change the way we're acting, or else come up with some dramatic deus-ex-machina breakthrough, to stop damaging the planet.

The unfortunate truth is that since the environmental and social movements of the 70s collapsed, collective environmental action has accomplished very little. Sure, our cars burn less gas per mile traveled and our lightbulbs use a quarter of the electricity. We've started growing tiny fractions of our food in slightly more sustainable ways. We've stopped using CFCs and the ozone layer is returning to normal even more quickly than we predicted. These are, for the most part, improvements. But our total impact is still increasing, and we have still put only the tiniest dent in the actual problem. The truth of the matter is that we have made no dramatic breakthroughs and have done nothing to change our lives, and the only way to put a big dent in the problem is by changing our lives.

Meanwhile, most "environmentalists" who say they are advocating for meaningful action are not showing much willingness to do anything meaningful themselves. Things like taking two steps to the side at Wal-Mart in order to buy LED lightbulbs and organic produce do not count as meaningful. These things do not require any kind of sacrifice or lifestyle change, and merely buying "green" products has no more power to help anyone deal with environmental problems at large than driving a Prius has the power to spray a stream of green plants and flowers behind the car on the highway, as in the commercials.

Meaningful lifestyle change actually happened in the 70s. People were encouraged to drive less, and gasoline was rationed. The politically created scarcity of oil reminded Americans that civilization was on a crash course for all kinds of other problems, and they responded by forming new kinds of organizations, planting gardens, and actually <span class="Formatted">*not doing*</span> things they otherwise would have because of their environmental impact. And it looked like we might actually correct our course and not only save energy but improve our communities and lives as well. But when the oil started looking plentiful again, the movement disappeared along with the crisis, disappeared so completely that many people who didn't live through it are essentially unaware it even happened. Today, we show no willingness to return to this kind of meaningful change. We'll swap out our lightbulbs for more efficient ones, we say, but there's no practical way the modern, worldly American can accomplish anything more than that.

And why should we try to do more than that, as individuals? Undoubtedly, that's a question many are asking themselves after a large group of climate scientists around the world signed another "warning to humankind" the other day. The signatories to this warning are not taking concrete individual action to prevent the eventualities they're warning about. To take only one example, many if not most of them incessantly fly around the world to conferences and meetings -- one of the very worst things an individual can do for their carbon footprint -- all the while proclaiming that we need to burn less fuel. For most of us, this sits about as well as seeing the cops speed past us on the freeway at 90mph with their lights off. It's next to impossible to see why <span class="Formatted">*we*</span> should use less gasoline or drive at the speed limit when the people who are telling us to do those things aren't doing it themselves.

This is the central cause of the failure of the current environmental movement: We do not want to come to terms with the magnitude of the damage we are doing and the future pain we are creating for ourselves and start looking into how we can stop doing this, because then we are brought face-to-face with the answer, which is that there is no easy solution. Even the people who study what we are doing to the planet refuse to do it, and the rest of us see that and come to the conclusion that there is nothing we can do.

<span class="Formatted">* *</span> *

So where is the problem with climate scientists jetting around the world? The carbon footprint of climate-related air travel is not all that big; it's not a whole lot of people, and they don't each consume <span class="Formatted">*all*</span> that much more fuel than the average citizen of a developed country. Can they go on doing whatever they want, because they make only an insignificant contribution to the problem?

Actually, <span class="Formatted">*most*</span> everyday actions have an insignificant impact in the grand scheme of things, and at least in most people's everyday sense of morality, that has no bearing on whether those actions are right. Take littering. I cause hardly any damage by throwing one pop can on the ground. Yet most socially conscious Americans today would intentionally litter only in extraordinary circumstances; we've agreed it's wrong, because the result if everyone does it is disastrous. Or, to look at a more extreme example, take murder. This does worse damage and affects more people than littering, but if I'm the only one who kills someone, that's still a drop in the bucket compared to all the problems and suffering in the world. Is it no big deal if I kill my neighbor?

These are not random examples. Virtually everything we do in modern industrial society, like it or not, is covering the planet with garbage, reducing the life expectancies of our descendants, and reducing the freedom of the less fortunate (both those living today and those who will live in the future). It is true that, aside from living in a cabin in the wilderness for the rest of our lives -- which itself would be unsustainable if everyone on the planet today did it -- we cannot eliminate this impact, any more than any human ever alive has been able to avoid killing any other living thing or permanently spreading out some of the universe's finite amount of concentrated energy. But this does not mean we cannot reduce our impact, and to the extent that anyone is morally obligated to do anything, I think we are all morally obligated to, at a minimum, work to understand the approximate environmental consequences of our actions and make an honest effort at reducing our impact, which will include some big decisions and real sacrifices. If we have very little money or means, we may not be able to do much, and that's okay (although sometimes it is possible to both save money and reduce our environmental impact, which should be an attractive proposition). If we have a lot, we can and should do more.

I hope it is clear that I am not arguing that everyone who gets on an airplane is a horrible person. Nor am I saying that climate scientists should absolutely never fly anywhere while attempting to understand what we're doing to our planet. There is more nuance to life than that. I am, however, suggesting that perhaps, if climate scientists want to be taken seriously and look like they are making some attempt to fulfill their personal moral responsibility, they just might find it helpful to actually take some publicly visible action to reduce their personal carbon footprints, such as, oh I don't know, agreeing to each cut out a certain ambitious percentage of flights per year, signing a big sheet of paper with a tabloid-headline title that splashes across the pages of the national newspapers, and actually sticking to it. Such an action would accomplish far more, both in terms of actual results and public opinion, than all their "warnings" and prominent meta-analyses put together.

It's true that your individual choices, or those of the world's climate scientists, will not, in themselves, save the world. But using the fact that we can't save the world by ourselves as an excuse for doing absolutely nothing is just that: an excuse, a lazy way to avoid taking responsibility for our own actions. And while the author of the Guardian article I read was not suggesting that everyone do nothing at all, his suggestion that we instead take political action to force big business to be more environmentally conscious still has the effect of conveniently eliminating individual responsibility from the equation and convincing us that we don't have an obligation to truly change our lives. Claiming that forcing fossil fuel companies and greedy big business to behave is all the change we need is like claiming that forcing gun sellers to do better background checks will solve America's gun violence problem. Sure, it wouldn't hurt, but it's only a small part of the problem. The real problem is the way we, the citizens of America, behave, and while it would be helpful for the government to make our choices easier through taxes and regulation, we still have a responsibility to choose correctly, just like we have a responsibility not to kill our neighbors regardless of whether the law says we can't.

<span class="Formatted">* *</span> *

That was our moral obligation. Is there any other reason to take individual action? To make a conscious effort to live differently in our own lives? As a matter of fact, there is.

It really isn't true that you as an individual have no power to cause greater change simply through how you live. Even massive, organized social movements -- the ones that cause real change throughout a society -- start with a few people, or even one person. Once in a while something as simple as refusing to give up your bus seat can kick off those changes. At the risk of oversimplifying, the civil rights movement didn't work because oppressed people petitioned a higher authority for help. It most certainly didn't work because people decided they were free to sit around on their duffs while waiting for someone else to solve the problem because there was nothing they could do by themselves. It worked because a few people decided what was happening was wrong and began quietly changing their lives to protest. Then a few more people saw, realized they should change their lives a bit too, and joined. Then, under competent leadership, a <span class="Formatted">*lot*</span> of people joined, and it became too difficult to ignore. The bus boycotts didn't work by directly pursuing political and organizational change, they worked by getting so many people to refuse to participate in an immoral system that political change became inevitable.

Another social movement is, hopefully, starting around us right now: one aiming to address the ridiculous frequency of sexual harassment, coercion, and abuse of power in certain industries. People have been trying to address these kinds of problem through various forms of legislation and activism for years. Has the issue finally started coming to our attention because people started insisting more loudly that Hollywood or Washington address the problem? No, it's starting because a number of brave individuals have decided to break out and "rock the boat" -- disrupting the status quo and violating others' expectations of them -- and share their experiences with the world. The political and organizational changes will happen once a large number of people have seen and been convinced of the tremendous magnitude of the problem, understood the social factors that allow this to take place, and thought about how we can change them.

Now granted, a famous actor accusing Harvey Weinstein has a lot more influence than me lowering my thermostat a few degrees and biking to work. And you will probably never be one of the handful of people like Rosa Parks who lights the fuse, regardless of what method you choose to pursue change. But it is in the nature of democracy that societal change can occur only after a sufficient degree of public awareness and will is raised. We are nowhere near that point on the issues of climate change, resource depletion, and many more. Sure, most people agree that these are issues, to some extent or another, but addressing these issues requires us to change our lives by making real sacrifices, and these sacrifices will not be only on the part of ExxonMobil executives. Until a large number of individuals begin to make these sacrifices, no sane legislature will begin to take meaningful collective action, because such meaningful action will reduce the living standards of its constituents and require changes that nearly everybody considers unacceptable. Will the government put substantial environmental taxes on the passenger air travel industry -- which currently accounts for a whopping 5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions -- when even the people who are telling us why we need to reduce our emissions are still flying more than necessary? Yeah, right. We have to make these kinds of changes seem acceptable first, and that can only happen when we change ourselves, find that it's okay, and encourage others to do the same.

The success of civil disobedience movements shows that we don't have to go around preaching to start convincing others to join us. Quietly recognizing that the status quo is wrong and standing apart from it is already extremely threatening to those in power. I've seen that I don't have to say a single word about someone else's choices to make them get defensive about their own environmental impact -- and, once in a while, make them start questioning whether they ought to be doing something as well. All I have to do is try to do something, however insufficient it may be, and as a result look a bit different.

Look different.

Okay, okay, it was "L", which still allows the transmission to adjust a bit, but it was still artificially limited to lower gear ratios.

I only realized what happened when I got to church and couldn't shift into park (because the shifter was over in the little "L" notch to the left).

"Don't worry, the fire is normal," he says.

Apparently when it gets really cold, the switches can freeze up, which is a problem because the computer-operated ones don't have human operators to give them some elbow grease. So they purposefully light fires (I'm not sure with what; they are quite yellow-orange and not pure gas -- maybe kerosene) over the switches to keep them warm.

Further, I don't know many people who are very intelligent but can't spell, even though otherwise there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of correlation. Might be interesting to study the literature on this a bit; I'm sure some work has been done on effective teaching strategies and so on.

(Perhaps a general tendency to remember fine details without particular effort is part of both high general intelligence and spelling ability, for example?)

<span class="PreProc" id="8839">@8839.</span> I developed a theory this summer but as far as I can tell never wrote it down that many, many problems are a combination of bad design and bad users (with both of those things being able to be defined liberally). For instance, a car accident may be a result of both the driver not paying attention and the car being designed in a way so that the driver was less likely to be able to pay attention. I'm having trouble actually coming up with good examples right now, but the main point is that we tend to seize on one or the other, and both are horribly wrong. If you point out the design when you make a mistake, you're taken as complaining; but then if you say people are just stupid when they make a mistake in your system, you're missing a big opportunity to prevent it from happening in the future. To effectively address big problems, it's crucial to attack them from both sides.

The water reached the town, and the streets were flooded under several feet of water. Another straggler came by in a boat and offered the man a lift. But he refused, saying, "God will protect me."

The water continued to rise. The man had to climb up on the roof to stay out of the floodwaters. After a few hours, a rescue helicopter came by and lowered a rope to the man, but he shouted out, "I'm okay! God will protect me!" Eventually the helicopter gave up and flew off.

The water rose above the top of the house and the man drowned. He arrived in heaven and immediately went to see God, angry that he had trusted in God and still drowned. He said, "God, why didn't you save me from drowning?"

God said, "Well, I sent you a radio warning, a boat, and a helicopter. What more did you want?"

What I realized sometime in the last couple of days is that this exposes a basic difference in intent. Unix, while originally a proprietary product for sure, grew out of a hacker community that was very focused on finding creative solutions to problems and helping other people out. So Unix is based on the principle of empowering users to solve their own problems. If a user can't figure out how to do something, or they issue a command that says to permanently delete the entire contents of the hard drive without confirmation, well tough on them. If the user does want to do something, Unix makes it possible, and when they start doing it, it gets out of their way.

Software by Microsoft and friends (especially including Windows since we compared to Unix, but both are really ecosystems rather than just operating systems) is based on the principle of making money for software companies. Back from the very beginning when Bill Gates wrote that famous open letter about hobbyists pirating his software, he was focused on the ability of enterprising people to make money from software. Now naturally of course Windows is not without its benefits to the user; if it didn't do <span class="Formatted">*something*</span> useful for the user it wouldn't have risen to its current state of prominence and it wouldn't be around now. It's not optimal certainly, but for that matter neither is Unix or anything else. But the core principles are not based on empowering the user. They're not even really based on being helpful to the user; being helpful to the user is a core goal only insofar as it's necessary to make the company money.

There's nothing intrinsically bad about capitalism necessarily, but I think it's pretty clear which philosophy is better for people. Not necessarily in terms of being easy and fun and pretty, and even necessarily in terms of being effective at getting a certain job done (because for people who are not experts, there are good arguments to be made for the Microsoft way in these dimensions). But which philosophy makes people satisfied with computers? Encourages people to learn how to do things for themselves? Sets computers up as a tool rather than something that tells us what to do and acts as a seemingly unavoidable money sink? I know where I'm pointing.

It was promptly bought by a squatter who set a CNAME redirect to churchofsatan.org. They now want $5,000 to give the domain back.

Instead, actions from within carefully chosen institutions (such as local government) need to be paired with actions entirely outside existing institutional structures, to build the momentum that will make change possible.

<span class="PreProc" id="9321">@9321.</span> So the other day they were demolishing a building on Vine Street, just to the west of Jostens (there's a parking lot or empty area of some kind so that you can see through to the spot behind Federated). Mike went up that way for lunch and came back hardly able to contain his laughter. For some reason the city had (probably negligently) not blocked off the street during the demolition, and some guy had parked his pickup truck right in front of the fence. Well, someone screwed something up during the process, and a large part of the building came down into the street, crushing the pickup flat as a pancake.

As with many such things, it's only funny because nobody got hurt, and it was a pretty close call -- two women apparently had to run to avoid getting hit by it. Mike knows the guy whose truck got squashed, and apparently he's going to try to sue someone over it. Which I have to say I don't really get; I can't imagine you're going to have any trouble recovering the cost of your vehicle, and hopefully replacement cost, even without a lawyer of any kind, after that kind of event.

You see, Dimmick alleges that, after breaking into the Rowleys' home with a knife and gun, they all then sat down and hashed out a deal under which they would hide him from police (the police who were right outside) for an unspecified amount of money. "Later," he complained, "the Rowleys reneged on said oral contract, resulting in my being shot in the back by authorities." Ergo, breach of contract.

Um, no, wrote the Rowleys' attorney in a motion to dismiss earlier this month. He had multiple arguments, all very good ones, as to why a contract claim would not fly here. First, there was no agreement. Second, if there was an agreement, there was no meeting of the minds on the amount of money (Dimmick admitted the "offer" was for "an unspecified amount"), and so no binding contract. Third, agreements made at knifepoint are, you may be surprised to learn, not enforceable as they are made "under duress." Finally, a contract to do something illegal (e.g. hide a fugitive) is also not enforceable.

Mr. Dimmick is representing himself.

True story: I found a performance bug in the Whidbey CLR jitter the other day. There's a bizarre situation in which a particular mathematical calculation interacts with a bug in the jitter that causes the jitter to run really slowly on a particular method. It's screwing up our performance numbers quite badly.  If I change one of the constants in the calculation to a variable, the problem goes away, because we no longer hit the buggy code path in the jitter.

They'll fix the bug before we ship, but consider a hypothetical. Suppose we hadn't found the bug until after we'd shipped Whidbey. Suppose I needed to change my code so that in runs faster in the buggy Whidbey CLR. What's the right thing to do?

Solution One: Change the constant to a variable in the affected method.  Put a comment as long as your arm in the code explaining to future maintenance programmers what the bug is, what versions of the framework causes the problem, how the workaround works, who implemented the workaround, and how to do regression testing should the underlying bug be fixed in future versions of the framework.  Realize that there might be similar problems elsewhere, and be on the lookout for performance anomalies.

Solution Two: Change all constants to variables. And from now on, program defensively; never use constants again -- because there might someday be a future version of the framework that has a similar bug. Certainly don't put any comments in the code. Make sure that no maintenance programmers can possibly tell the necessary, by-design uses of variables from the unnecessary, pointless uses. Don't look for more problems; assume that your heuristic solution of never using constants again is sufficient to prevent not only this bug, but future bugs that don't even exist yet. Tell other people that "constants are slower than variables", without any context.  And if anyone questions why that is, tell them that you've been programming longer than they have, so you know best.  Maybe throw in a little "Microsoft suxors, open source rulez!" rhetoric while you're at it -- that stuff never gets old.

They think the primary issue with Trump is that he's a racist and a sexist and a bigot, and their role is to urge artists to represent strong female characters and characters of colour, to repeatedly and explicitly point out how bad Trump is, and to stridently stick up for a highly particular, narrow conception of racial politics.

We need so much more than this from our leading lights -- we need them to hold female characters and characters of colour to the same literary standards they hold white male characters, so they don't look tokenistic and breed resentment. We need them to help us address racial injustice in a manner which comports with the need to reshape the Democratic Party into an effective apparatus for pursuing justice and the need to construct a broadly based egalitarian coalition that can win throughout the country. And we need them to give those artists -- and those art critics -- who cannot make positive contributions in these directions the space to do their own thing. Because when they get politics wrong, they lock us in the same old boxes the Clinton campaign locked us in. She was a woman, and if you didn't think that was enough, you were a sexist or a racist, and if you were black and you didn't think she was enough, you were a race traitor, and if you didn't speak up for her early and often, shame on you. It was this kind of discursive climate that led Clinton to call her opponents deplorables and led so many of her supporters to affirm and defend that language. If they want to help, our artists and art critics need to contribute to building something more effective, something which reaches out instead of digging in.

<span class="PreProc" id="9594">@9594.</span> Had a thought I don't think I've ever quite elicitated in exactly this way before about multiple 'return' statements in a function (which, in general, I'm in favor of despite the camp that doesn't like them and considers it bad structure). Namely, it is certainly possible to produce a function where using too many return statements makes it hard to read. On the other hand, if you <span class="Formatted">*have*</span> such a function, I think the problem is not the return statements but the fact that you basically have spaghetti code, or at least confusingly written code. If you just refactored your code a bit to remove a function or two, I think your return points would stop looking like an issue. Basically, having multiple confusing return statements is a symptom rather than a cause of the bad code.

Which I guess doesn't mean you should just write 'return' wherever the hell you want; if you have a crapton of return statements that aren't in a regular pattern, that's still a code smell. But it means that as a <span class="Formatted">*rule*</span>, "multiple returns is bad" is, well, a bad rule.

While I'm on this topic, as a way to refute people who say that in principle multiple returns are bad, which of the following would you rather read?

<span class="Constant">@@@</span>
<span class="Constant">def f(x):</span>
<span class="Constant">    myReturn = 6</span>
<span class="Constant">    if is_frobnicated(x):</span>
<span class="Constant">        myReturn = 12</span>
<span class="Constant">    return myReturn</span>

def g(x):
    if is_frobnicated(x):
        return 12
    else:
        return 6
<span class="Constant">@@@</span>

g(x) reads exactly like what it does. f(x) forces you to figure out some things about how logic works that should not be required in order to read the function. Similarly, if you reach a point in a function at which you know what the result of the function is, you should just <span class="Formatted">*make that the result of the function*</span>, not keep going on checking things and adding conditional blocks. Again, if that makes it hard to read, your function sucks to begin with.

<span class="PreProc" id="9633">@9633.</span> Events at the 1904 Summer Olympics marathon in St. Louis:
- The marathon was scheduled for the middle of the afternoon. In the summer. On an unseasonably humid day even for Missouri. The heat index was estimated at 135 degrees.
- Water was provided only at the 11-mile mark, because one of the organizers wanted to do some research on dehydration (never mind that that can kill people).
- Most of the race went over dusty country roads, which caused the race officials' cars to kick up massive amounts of dust that caused at least one runner internal respiratory injuries that nearly killed him.
- The first person who crossed the finish line gave up about a third of the way in and hitchhiked back to five miles from the stadium, then ran the rest of the way because the car he was riding in broke down. He was then hailed as the winner and had his picture taken with Teddy Roosevelt's daughter Alice before it was discovered he hadn't actually run the whole race. He quickly admitted what he did and assured everyone he was joking; nevertheless he was "permanently" barred from the Olympics, only to be reinstated the following year.
- The actual "winner" of the event was half-carried to the finish line and given multiple doses of strychnine mixed with brandy by his trainers after they physically restrained him from giving up and lying down partway through. He was barely alive, probably would have died at the scene if doctors hadn't been there to treat him, and never ran competitively again.
- A Cuban runner arrived for the race at about the last minute possible, having lost all his money in New Orleans and hitchhiked the remainder of the way to St. Louis. Owing to his late arrival and misadventures, he ran in street clothes, with his pants cut off to form shorts. He hadn't eaten in nearly two days by the time he started the race, so he stopped in an orchard along the course to eat some apples, which turned out to be rotten and gave him severe stomach cramps; nevertheless he finished the race in fourth place.
- The ninth and twelfth finishers were from South Africa, and had originally come as part of a sideshow, not to run the marathon. The ninth-place finisher would have done much better if he hadn't been chased off the course by a whole mile by aggressive dogs.
- Fewer than half of the entrants finished the race, the worst ratio ever.

<span class="PreProc" id="9721">@9721.</span> Chesterton's Fence:
In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."

This paradox rests on the most elementary common sense. The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease. But the truth is that nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, or that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served. But if he simply stares at the thing as a senseless monstrosity that has somehow sprung up in his path, it is he and not the traditionalist who is suffering from an illusion.

Master Wq was eating his luncheon when a student burst into his room and knelt at his feet. Tears were in his eyes and he seemed profoundly frustrated. Master Wq put down his bowl and asked, "What upsets you so, young man?"

"Master," he said. "I give up. I will never attain mastery of Vim! I will never learn the ways of the great patriarchs! I will never attain the brutal simplicity, the divine emptiness of perfectly efficient Vim usage!"

"Why do you say this?"

"I am your worst student, by far. When I am struggling with writing a simple macro, my fellow students are writing recursive macros with ease. When I am trying to remember the regular expression for white space characters, my fellow students are writing cyclomatic complexity tests in Vimscript. I am too slow, and I am ashamed, and I am afraid I have failed."

Master Wq stood up. "Come with me to the window," he said.

The student got up and followed Master Wq to the window, and looked across the street to Master Wq's neighbour's house. Through the window, the two could see a young man in suit and tie, working on a document.

"What do you see?" asked Master Wq. The student watched for a while.

"That young man is using Microsoft Excel to generate a spreadsheet. He is updating every single cell by hand. He doesn't even know how to use formulas. He makes capital letters by pressing Caps Lock, and then pressing it again when he is done. He is so slow! I do not understand. How can he be so content?"

"Seeing this young man, how can you not be?" returned Master Wq.

The student was immediately enlightened. His name was Qa, and he later became one of the great masters.

<span class="PreProc" id="10029">@10029.</span> So I think this is one of my best random ideas in a while: the Municipal Vehicular Practice Lot.
You create an MVPL when a large institution moves and leaves behind a much larger parking lot than is required at a location. Rather than just have a massive parking lot there, as so often happens, you divide it into two lots. One serves the normal function, and the other becomes the MVPL. As the name suggests, you go there when you want to practice driving, biking, skateboarding, etc., in some unusual way. You can book it out online so that you have the lot to yourself and don't have to worry about other people getting in the way. There's a place nearby where you can check out orange cones. To the extent possible with minimal maintenance, there are small areas of gravel, ice, etc.

Not that the lack of MVPLs is one of the world's major problems, or even really minor problems, but it does serve a real need (albeit one that can be served less well in other ways) and it provides a useful thing to do with a huge old lot that would otherwise sit unused.

A fellow had just been hired as the new CEO of a large high tech corporation. The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes. "Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve," he said.

Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and he was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wit's end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, "Blame your predecessor."

The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street - responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.

About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, "Reorganize." This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.

After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope. The message said, "Prepare three envelopes."

It wasn't an isolated incident, Crawford told Bay News 9 last month. Oakley had a "habit of licking men that either she was attracted to or thought that she had authority over," he said.

"The act of licking a person on the face and neck is too unusual to be contrived by multiple witnesses and multiple victims," administrative law judge Robert S. Cohen wrote in his final report. He recommended she be fined $5,000 and publicly censured by the governor for inappropriate behavior.

"I mean, she licked a lot of people, sir. So everyone kind of talked about the fact that she licked people. That's what she did when she got drunk."

The news warns that even one drink per day carries a risk. But how great is that risk?

For each set of 100,000 people who have one drink a day per year, 918 can expect to experience one of the 23 alcohol-related problems in any year. Of those who drink nothing, 914 can expect to experience a problem. This means that 99,082 are unaffected, and 914 will have an issue no matter what. Only 4 in 100,000 people who consume a drink a day may have a problem caused by the drinking, according to this study.

At two drinks per day, the number experiencing a problem increased to 977. Even at five drinks per day, which most agree is too much, the vast majority of people are unaffected.

I'm not advocating that people should ignore these risks. They are real, but they are much smaller than many other risks in our lives, and much less than the headlines would have you believe, especially at the levels that most agree are permissible.

"No, but I know exactly where I am," Heisenberg replies.

The cop says, "You were doing 55 in a 35."

Heisenberg throws up his hands and shouts, "Great! Now I'm lost!"

The cop thinks this is suspicious and orders him to pop open the trunk. The cop checks it out and says, "Do you know you have a dead cat back here?"

* Sorting something like beans and putting the good stuff in the bad pile
* Dumping out the wrong side of a strainer
* Coding if(!x) instead of if(x) or vice versa
* Inverting "member" and "member of" in a security hierarchy

I think it's precisely because there are so few choices that it's easy to make -- it feels like it should be super easy so you don't spend much energy thinking about it.

Q: What is the length of the hair an average cat sheds in a month in cm, laid end to end?
A: I read recently that the average person sheds about 150 hairs per day, and there are 30 days in a month. My hair is about 10 inches long, or 20cm; that's longer than most cats, but a cat probably has thicker hair than me as well. That makes about 100000 cm/month. An average cat probably has about ten times as much area covered in hair as my head, so 1 million cm/month. (Which is astounding. But correct.)

<span class="PreProc" id="10341">@10341.</span> So my current philosophy is that deadlines are stupid when you create them artificially for yourself. Sometimes they exist and they're fine, when they correspond to something out of my control. For instance, I have to have my Christmas presents ready by December 25 if I want to give them to people on Christmas; the date of Christmas isn't under my control and Christmas will come then no matter what I do.

The new thing is that I had a realization about why they're so unhelpful. I think it's because your priorities are constantly changing, or they <span class="Formatted">*should*</span> be. When they change, suddenly your deadlines don't necessarily make sense any more -- they might be too early or even too late. When the deadline is too early, you feel bad when it slips by even though your decision to change it was totally justifiable. When the deadline is too late, you don't get it done until then because that was the deadline you set, even if things changed and it really kind of should have been done earlier. When you free yourself from the stupid dates and just get good at prioritizing things instead of using fear of dates showing up, you are free to adjust anytime. Further, I find at least for myself that there's much less temptation to procrastinate.

<span class="PreProc" id="10344">@10344.</span> I've noticed recently that the 'www.' on websites is becoming less common and visible. You comparatively rarely see it in marketing materials, for instance, and fewer websites will redirect you to www. if you use the root domain. (But then I looked at the websites I currently have open and most of them still have the dubs, so...maybe I'm overestimating that part of it.)

Might go along with the increase in the use of the metonym "Internet" for the Web. Like, the silly words like "Information Superhighway" died away in the 90s, but now even the actual proper name is rarely heard and we just call it by the big, ugly network it runs on. You don't even hear "Web browser" anymore, it's just a "browser."

<span class="PreProc" id="10386">@10386.</span> "Why is software on that extreme of the spectrum? The reason is that in software we are developing idealized mathematical objects. You can build a complicated castle and have it rest on a thin line and it will stay up because it doesn't weigh anything. In other fields, people have to cope with the perversity of matter -- of physical objects. Matter does what it is going to do. You can try to model it, but if the actual behaviour doesn't fit the model then tough on you, because the challenge is to make physical objects that really work. If I want to put an if-statement in a while-statement, I don't have to worry about whether the if-statement will oscillate at a certain frequency and rub against the while-statement and eventually they will fracture. I don't have to worry whether it will oscillate at a certain high frequency and induce a signal in the value of some other variable. I don't have to worry about how much current that if-statement will draw, and whether it can dissipate the heat there inside that while-statement, or whether there will be a voltage drop across the while-statement that will make the if-statement not function. I don't have to worry that if I run this program in a salt water environment, the salt water may get in between the if-statement and the while-statement and cause corrosion. [The audience laughs all through this.] I don't have to worry, when I refer to the value of a variable, whether I am exceeding the fan-out limit by referring to it 20 times. I don't have to worry how much capacitance it has, and whether there has been sufficient time to charge up the value. I don't have to worry, when I write the program, about how I am going to physically assemble each copy and whether I can manage to get access to put that ifstatement inside the while-statement. I don't have to worry about how I am going to gain access in case that if-statement breaks, to remove it and replace it with a new one. There are so many problems that we don't have to worry about in software; that makes it fundamentally easier to write a program than to design a physical object that's going to work." <span class="Underlined">--Richard Stallman</span>

At least not on the front end: they resist planning meetings, presentations, and strategic operations until the last minute. But what happens if you don't plan ahead of time? In many cases, crisis! ("Didn't you get the tickets?" "I thought you were going to do that!") Then, when the urgency of the last minute is upon you, the reactive planning model ensues. What's the first level of focus when the stuff hits the fan? Action! Work harder! Overtime! More people! Get busier! And a lot of stressed-out people are thrown at the situation. Then, when having a lot of busy people banging into each other doesn't resolve the situation, someone gets more sophisticated and says, "We need to get <span class="Formatted">*organized*</span>!"

It's quite possible that there's already discussion of this, but it seems that technology today is focused on two sorts of needs: ones at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy and those at the top. As technology advances (and remains somewhat cheap), these properties could be amplified, and we could have technology that is designed to help people achieve self actualization, express themselves creatively, and, at the other end of the spectrum, tell them where to get some cheap food (though not really provide that food). But at the same time, it might do little to help navigate a fraying social/community/economic fabric, stay healthy, employed, etc. (As an exercise, think about how well technology helps people stay healthy, employed, or close to their neighbors. At best, it seems to not make these worse.) This effect may be the most insidious when it becomes lopsided -- when the benefits of technology are skewed to the top of the hierarchy, and we end up with the post-NGO scenario described above.

You should try that -- it's a trivial tactical suggestion which helps address you systematically low-balling yourself, which you're prone to.

<span class="PreProc" id="11251">@11251.</span>
KNEELING DOWN
* Safety first, before kneeling make sure there are no hazards around, that the ground/floor is flat and leveled, not slippery and that there are no sharp or dangerous objects where you are about to kneel. Visualize kneeling down and standing up and make sure you will not hit your head or body with nearby objects, furniture or walls. Make sure that the kneeling pad is not wet or covered with any remains that might cause you to slip or fall. Follow all the safety instructions.
* Place the kneeling pad where you intend to use it.
* Stand behind the kneeling pad, keep a wide base of support, your feet should be shoulder-width apart.
* Squat down to the floor, bending at the hips and knees only. You can position your stronger leg slightly forward to maintain balance.
* Make sure that the kneeling pad does not slide.
* Secure the kneeling pad down to the ground/floor with your hands holding the kneeling pad at its ends.
* Slowly, place one knee on the kneeling pad followed by the other.
* Do not kneel for prolonged periods of time without standing up and walking around.

STANDING UP
* Secure the kneeling pad down to the ground/floor with your hands holding the kneeling pad at its ends.
* Slowly push your knees off the kneeling pad by moving slightly backwards into a squatting position.
* Stand up by slowly straightening your legs. Do not stand up too quickly as this could make you light-headed.
* While taking a break, keep away from the reach of children. When finished, store the kneeling pad according to the care instructions.

The novel itself is fantastic, I enjoyed every page of it.

This review is about the physical printed book, which is "Brave New World: Special Edition", Publisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.

I'd say this is the worst book I ever held in my hands. It is a complete nonsense, it is made by someone who never read a book in his life and doesn't know why would other people do that. They downloaded a free EPUB from some site on the internet and turned into a printed book.

There are no page numbers. There is a table of contents, like Chapter One, Chapter Two, but no numbers in it nor on the pages.

The text is printed in tiny Times New Roman with long lines and inadequate line spacing. it is almost impossible to read.
It all looks like a pirated text in an MS Word file.

The "Special Edition" is misleading. There is zero additional content in the book, not a word.
The original epigraph is missing.

A sailing ship painting on the cover. Seriously? Do they think it is a nautical novel?

I couldn't read it and I would be ashamed to donate it. It belongs to the recycle bin.

This is my answer too. Computers are just gratuitously complicated.

"Well, you see, Firefox has something called extensions-- Okay, Firefox is a /browser/, it's a program you use to get on the internet, like the thing you thought was "Google", but was actually "Chrome," remember when I explained that earlier? Okay well an extension is like a attachment that adds features... Exactly, like "Adblock Plus," but AdBlock Plus is no good anymore, so now you have to use uBlock. But don't mix it up with μBlock, which is a piece of crap intentionally designed to confuse you, and which manipulates the search results so that it's the first result. Uh, search results?

It's strange to think about how I'd be literally incapable of writing the same book if I'd started it in 2020, bc I'm not in the same mental space anymore. It's just weird that ppl can produce these bodies of work or writing or thinking, but then be unable to do that same thing X number of years later. We say this person is the "author" of that work or like an "expert" on the topic, but it was really only in their head for a fleeting amount of time, so is it really about them at all?

But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time.

One thing I'm not sure people fully appreciate is that if you slash mortality in half, you only end up increasing mean life expectancy by about 8 years. Aging is an exponential process, and it's often hard to get a grasp on just how strong that is.

According to the SSA's period life tables, you have around a 1/1000 chance of dying during your entire elementary school years (around ages 5-12).

At age 25, you have the same chance of dying just that year alone (not preconditioned on your sex... at this age in particular it's much worse for males than females).

When you're 50, it's around 3 months.

At 65, one month.

80, a week.

And lastly, when you're 100, you have a 1/1000 chance of dying every single day -- the same as your entire time in elementary school.

When you're dealing with an exponential like this, quite large changes in chance of death end up having relatively little effect on life expectancy, because the rise catches up quite fast. I'm hopeful that more work can be done in the future on therapies that can actually slow down the process (and "flatten the curve", if you will), which would have a much larger downstream impact in the end.

You may not have had Covid-19, but the virus has still been living rent free in your head for over a year. Kick it out.

It is important to live and embrace life. It's your life, and (pending heroic efforts to the contrary) it's ending one minute at a time. If you're vaccinated and in a place with the virus under control, go out there and live yours!

That does not mean going back to your old life, if that's not the life you want.

This is the time to take stock. Figure out where you want to live, what you want to do with your life and who you want by your side when you do it. Do things that matter, and things that bring you joy. Go on a trip, see the world, start a business, fall in love, start a family, go out and talk to people in person. And other neat stuff like that.

You'll be asked to wear masks for a while. If you're asked, wear them. It's fine.

If you are asked for much more than that, take your business and your life elsewhere.

That's all there is to it. That does not mean forgetting what happened, or that it's not important to learn from the experience and update our models, actions and precautions. It also doesn't mean dismissing the situation overseas as a pure Someone Else's Problem, or that keeping an eye on things every so often isn't prudent -- so long as it stops screwing up your life.

<span class="PreProc" id="11726">@11726.</span> On a Hacker News thread about your worst "I broke prod" story:
Can it be a story I was involved in but I didn't do it?

I used to work for a major university as a student systems admin. The only thing that was "student" about it was the pay-- I had a whole lab of Sun and SGI servers/desktops, including an INCREDIBLE 1TB of storage-- we had 7xSun A1000's (an array of arrays) if memory serves.

Our user directories were about 100GB at the time. I had sourced this special tape drive that could do that, but it was fidgety (which is not something you want in a backup drive admittedly). The backups worked, I'd say, 3/4ths of the time. I think the hardware was buggy, but the vendor could never figure it out. Also, before you lecture me, we were very constrained with finances, I couldn't just order something else.

So I graduated, and as such had to find a new admin. We interviewed two people, one was very sharp and wore black jeans and a black shirt-- it was obvious he couldn't afford a suit which would have been the correct thing to wear. The other candidate had suit, and he was punching below his weight. Over my objections, suit guy gets hired.

Friday night, my last day of employment I throw tapes into the machine and start a full L0 backup which would take all weekend to complete.

Monday morning I get a panicked phone calls from my former colleagues. "The new guy deleted the home directories!"

The suit guy literally, had in his first few hours destroyed the entire labs research. All of it. Anyways, I said something to the effect of, "Is the light on the AIT array green or amber?"

"Green."

As you watch carefully, they flick a switch on the wall. The switch looks like a light switch, but none of the lights in the kitchen turn on or off. Next, they open a cabinet and take down a mug, set it on the worktop, and then tap it twice with a teaspoon. They wait for thirty seconds, and finally they reach behind the refrigerator, where you can't see, and pull out a different mug, this one full of fresh coffee.

...What just happened? What was flicking the switch for? Was tapping the empty mug part of the procedure? Where did the coffee come from?

That's what this code is like.

People often say things like "I think slower than I type", but I don't think that this is correctly modeling the problem, because it's only true over long timescales.

Consider this: the average American uses only 7 GB of mobile data per month. Would they be happy with 50 kilobits per second? That's much faster than their average usage rate, so in some sense, the data rate wouldn't be the limiting factor.

It's very much the same with typing speed. Yes, your internal word generation rate might be slower than you type if we're looking at an hour by hour, or even minute by minute scale. But once you have a thought crafted, it's beneficial to get it out as quickly as possible.

In case you're wondering how I spent such a milestone of a day [my 40th birthday]: well, I spent hours of it at an important virtual grant review meeting with the Department of Defense. Alas, when it came time for my own big presentation at that meeting -- about what my students and I had done over the past five years to lay the theoretical foundations for the recent achievement of quantum computational supremacy -- I'd uploaded the completely wrong PowerPoint file (it was something.pptx rather than something.ppt, where they weren't two versions of the same presentation). Sorting this out took about 10 minutes, destroyed my momentum, and wasted everyone's time. I partly blame the Microsoft Teams platform, whose limitations as conferencing software compared to Zoom necessitated emailing my presentation in the first place. But of course, part of the blame rests with me.

I had to explain apologetically to the US Department of Defense that I'm no good with tech stuff -- being a mere computer science PhD. And unlike many of my colleagues (who I envy), back in my youth -- for at age 40 I'm no longer young -- I never had enough time to become both the kind of person who might earn a big grant to do quantum computing theory, and the kind of person who'd be minimally competent at the logistics of a review meeting for such a grant.

Have you ever needed the amount of ketchup in a <span class="Formatted">*single*</span> ketchup packet? It seems like say, doubling their size would result in a very minor amount of wasted ketchup but save consumers a bunch of trouble and reduce the cost of packaging, which surely has to be significant -- a ketchup packet is about as much packet as ketchup!

Maybe people regularly require the amount of ketchup in three or five packets, so they would be wasting one? (That seems unlikely though -- do people seriously know how much ketchup they need to that level of precision?) Or maybe if people feel like they're taking a ton of ketchup packets, they'll use less ketchup, and since they're usually provided for free this cancels out the increased expense (this seems the most likely).

Overall I got the impression that health care was a bizarro-world where normal economics doesn't apply. If you have the courage to say loudly and firmly 'we refuse to pay a high price for this', then providers have to give you a low price, and your health care system will be great and affordable. Seems hard to believe, but the US sure does pay twice as much per capita as countries that go with the 'loudly refuse to pay more than a certain amount' strategy. I would have appreciated a book by a more economically-minded person explaining why things are like this. Or maybe not; maybe it's like quantum physics, and the second someone looks at it too closely, the whole structure will collapse, every hospital in the world will go bankrupt, and we'll have to get our medical problems treated by wolves.

<span class="PreProc" id="12227">@12227.</span> From my St. Olaf Helpdesk journal:
It seems I'm also unofficial support for the stapler since the IT help station is next to it at the circulation desk. At least once a shift, someone asks me if they can have a stapler. (And every time, the answer is "right under your hand" or "right next to you." People wouldn't see the stapler if it were fluorescent yellow and flying through the air in front of their faces in circles.)

Today someone first wanted a staple remover, which we didn't have; I offered him my pocketknife, but he resolutely pried them out with his fingernails. Then he--I kid you not--asked me if he was using the stapler incorrectly because it wouldn't staple all the way through the stack of papers he had. It was fairly thick, but one <span class="Formatted">*could*</span> reasonably expect it to be staple-able. I was a little bit baffled at being asked for help in stapling a document, but I took the stapler and tried to use it, and of course it didn't work for me either, despite my (different?) stapling technique. Then it ran out of staples (go figure) and I had to go ask for more.

I then had a thought and flipped around the little plate that makes the staples bend outwards instead of inwards, because outwards tends to work better for larger documents. Surprisingly, this actually made it work. So if my desk gets renamed "Office Implement Help," I guess I do deserve to be there. I actually know what that little plate on the stapler is for, after all -- and what's more, it was actually useful knowledge for once.

When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.

And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day -- days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work.

<span class="PreProc" id="12290">@12290.</span> Big question of Mother Night: Is Campbell guilty? Yet at the same time it's almost beside the point. The two big things that are in favor of and against him are almost in different ontologies or moral universes. Espionage is weird, breaks most of the normal rules, and it's almost impossible to know what would have happened had you chosen a different path. And so Campbell doesn't know what he himself did, nor does anybody else exactly. On the other hand, his propaganda was brilliant and even managed to speak to US citizens. The Nazis ate it up despite seemingly consciously knowing it was an absurd caricature. So I don't know if there's an answer here.

Vonnegut says that the moral of the story is that you are what you intend to be, but I don't think that that implies that Campbell has become a Nazi. He's become a person who can't feel and is deeply divided; he doesn't know why he's doing anything or why anything matters, precisely because he's had to take himself apart in order to do these things at the same time. I don't think he believes he's a Nazi or believes in their ideology or anything, and I don't know for sure that he had a net negative impact on the world. His statement that he's hanging himself for "crimes against himself" is apt, but at the same time it's hard to really say anything is his fault. "War is hell" as is quoted in the book, and loss of ability to feel is just what happens during the Holocaust. It's hard to make meaning out of anything next to that; it is unbelievable to the degree that logic and meaning just go out the window when you look at it. And it's unclear what extent Campbell was able to know what he was getting into when he started.

Maybe what happens is not that Campbell becomes a monster, but that he becomes someone who's capable of being a Nazi propagandist and not feeling like he's a monster. That's not someone you want to be. It's almost the worst thing you can do to your own soul.

As I dug deeper, however, I realized that the transformation of our romantic lives cannot be explained by technology alone; there's much more to the story. In a very short period of time, the whole culture of finding love and a mate has radically changed. A century ago people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after they decided neither party seemed like a murderer, the couple would get married and have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-two. Today people spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.

<span class="PreProc" id="12364">@12364.</span> Speaking of emoji, I just want to admit that I was wrong about emoji when they first became popular in the mid-2010s, and similarly for the "react" feature (that uses them) on chat platforms. I'm not about to suggest adding emoji to books or anything, but in the severely de-emotionalized and context-free environment of short-form text chat, I think they not only make it easier to communicate, but even add expressiveness to the medium. It's usually, if not always, possible to duplicate the effect with words, but you often have to spend quite a while figuring it out if you don't want to sound corny or heavy-handed, which means most of the time it's just not worth it. It's the natural-language equivalent of a programming language comparison: yeah I technically could implement the same thing in a Python list comprehension or a Brainfuck program, but...no.

In retrospect, I'm puzzled why I found them so stupid: everyone in the tech world had been using the old-style emoticons for several decades, and they caught on for exactly the same reasons. Emoji are just an incremental improvement and expansion on those. And obviously when you're using text for interactive communication, you want some way to communicate emotions and reactions. I guess that is just so transparent when interacting in person that we didn't think about it?

I eventually discovered a life changing life-hack which I have now used for years to force myself to finish and release music. It's called 'Christmas Music'.

Yes, Christmas Music.

It's the perfect tool to force an over thinking musician to buckle up and finish something. It provides three key benefits:

(1) A theme: what to write about is always a hard question. Christmas music massively narrows your options, and gives you a world of existing references to draw on.

(2) Low Stakes: Generally people don't like Christmas music, and consider it as essentially a joke. When you release your art into the world, it always feels like the stakes are high, even when there is absolutely no risk involved. If you can tell yourself 'no need to worry it's just christmas music', then you have art without fear

(3) A deadline: This is the real key. Christmas music needs to come out before Christmas. So you have to finish it. Voila.

I've now released some sort of Christmas music every year since 2013. Some is good. Some is bad. But it all exists and is published.

But does it mean you're more likely to have people continue liking you only for those shallow reasons, and not having any permanent interest, thus meaning you would have been better off if they dropped you at the beginning?

I'm thinking no (and thus this is basically just good), because there's usually not enough information for people to judge you on deep reasons at the beginning, but not sure!

<span class="PreProc" id="12470">@12470.</span> So my new wireless router was a pain to configure and is giving me cruddy download speeds (it appears to not support Gigabit Ethernet at all, in 2022, and when I was downloading updates from Pacman earlier I was getting literally 5Mbps -- not sure how it can be that bad). When I went on Amazon to see if I had misread the specs, I noticed that my router didn't look even a little bit like the picture, except for the big antennas on top. Nor were the ports in the back the same. Nor was the model number the same, or even the <span class="Formatted">*brand*</span>. All with a big banner that says "You purchased this item on May 25, 2022." Turns out I ordered a D-Link 2600AC, and I received an Asus AC1300, in a brown cardboard box labeled "D-Link 2600AC". (It's basically half of the one I ordered. :P)

Interestingly, there was a bunch of what appeared to be worn-out strapping tape on the top. I wonder if there was some funny business where someone swapped it with a cheaper one, or if some were returned and someone repackaged the wrong one.

Had a chat with customer service and they're going to send me a new one and I can return the old one at my convenience, so more annoying than anything else. Not sure I have all the original packaging, but I'll do my best. Also kind of funny. I just hope the second one is actually what I ordered! And I'm glad I noticed -- if it weren't for this one being noticeably worse in terms of supplied connection speed, I might never have noticed and just have gotten stuck with substantially worse hardware at good-hardware prices.

<span class="PreProc" id="12519">@12519.</span> I had a discussion with one of my colleagues the other day about the perfect tense and realized that I had actually had the wrong impression of the distinction. The line I took exception to in what he had asked me to read for style was something to the effect of, "We worked hard for the last two months to bring you this update." I pointed out that it needs to be "we have worked" (or maybe continuous, "we have been working"), and I said this was because "it's complete."

He asked, "But wouldn't that mean we aren't going to work hard anymore?"

The answer to that, of course, is no, that's just not the impression a native speaker gets from that sentence, but I couldn't square that fact with my explanation, so I spent my next two showers thinking about this, and I realized that my explanation was completely wrong. The distinction isn't about whether the action is "complete" per se, but whether it <span class="Formatted">*continues uninterrupted through the present moment*</span>. (If anything, I was backwards -- the simple past is arguably more complete than the present perfect since its action does not continue through the present.) I came up with two interesting examples demonstrating this.

(1) Life and death: correct tense is mutually exclusive.
    (a) I have lived for 27 years.
        Correct: So far 27 years of living have elapsed for me,
                 and I am still living at the present moment.

    (b) *I lived for 27 years.
        Wrong: This statement is semantically invalid
               in any plausible world except the afterlife,
               because it implies the action does not continue through the present,
               and thus that I'm now dead.
        (It would be semantically valid to say instead,
         "I lived in the United States for 27 years";
         this is different because one can cease to live in a place and still make statements.
         But this would be factually incorrect for me
         because I have always lived in the United States and still do.
         I could <span class="Formatted">*also*</span> say "I have lived in the United States for 27 years"; see (2).)

    (c) Mozart lived for 35 years (viz., from 1756-91).
        Correct: This is a true statement and grammatically correct.

    (d) Mozart has lived for 35 years.
        Wrong: This statement, while grammatically and semantically acceptable,
               is factually incorrect,
               because it implies that Mozart is still living
               and the 35 years under discussion are an uninterrupted range ending in 2022,
               while in fact Mozart died about 230 years ago.

    (e) Mozart has been dead for 231 years.
        Correct: This is a true statement and grammatically correct.

    (f) *Mozart was dead for 231 years.
        Wrong: Semantically invalid because this implies that he came back to life at some subsequent point;
               either he's still alive now, or he was briefly resurrected and then he died again.
               (Because death is permanent, it always continues until the present time
                and thus requires the perfect tense.)

(2) Relationships: both simple past and present perfect are correct, but have completely different meanings.
    (a) Alice and I have been together for two years.
        This means we're still dating:
            that is, the statement also applies today
            and has not stopped applying since the beginning of the two years.
        (I could probably still say this if we had broken up and gotten back together,
         but only if it was a relatively short period of time.)

    (b) Alice and I were together for two years.
        This means we broke up (or she died).
            That might have happened yesterday or 40 years ago,
            but it was necessarily prior to today,
            and some period in which we weren't together has intervened.

    Because both (a) and (b) are acceptable, just with different meanings,
    you can even combine them if the situation warrants:

    (c) Alice and I were together for two years.
        Then we broke up over a disagreement about cheesecake.
        After a couple of months, we realized what a stupid mistake that was.
        Now we've been together for another year, and we're getting married next month.

        (Hey, we need a happy ending after all these deaths.)

In the case of our RemNote release, the announcement finalized the 1.8 release, so the action of working on the release continued through the present moment, and the perfect tense was required. (The phrase "the last two months" forces the perfect tense, because it means the two months immediately prior to the current day, without any gaps. This is, I think, what intuitively flagged the tense as incorrect for me as a native speaker.)

You have probably never written a significant piece of correct software.

That's not a value judgement. It's certainly not a criticism of your competence. I can say with almost complete confidence that every non-trivial piece of software I have written contains at least one bug. You might have written small libraries that are essentially bug free, but the chance that you have written a non-trivial bug free program is tantamount to zero.

I don't even mean this in some pedantic academic sense. I'm talking about behaviour where if someone spotted it and pointed it out to you you would probably admit that it's a bug. It might even be a bug that you cared about.

Why is this?

Well, lets start with why it's not: It's not because we don't know how to write correct software. We've known how to write software that is more or less correct (or at least vastly closer to correct than the norm) for a while now. If you look at the NASA development process they're pretty much doing it.

Also, if you look at the NASA development process you will probably conclude that we can't do that. It's orders of magnitude more work than we ever put into software development. It's process heavy, laborious, and does not adapt well to changing requirements or tight deadlines.

The problem is not that we don't know how to write correct software. The problem is that correct software is too expensive.

There's just...nothing happening most of the time, especially at night. It's odd to think this is how it used to be pretty much everywhere before humans made noisy machines running around all the time. Of course I'm alone and other people make noise too, but...not much. Not compared to all that. Not Just Bikes has this piece on cities not being loud, cars being loud; I wonder if the city of the future can be massively quieter. While the quiet isn't exactly something I find myself craving or missing most of the time, it's hard to imagine that constant noise in excess of what we've evolved to deal with isn't bad for us, and I've heard of research that agrees.

<span class="PreProc" id="12738">@12738.</span> I want to write a blog post about how embarrassing it is that eBooks are so shitty.

There might be some interesting social effects. Like why is less effort being put in to make them look good? It seems easier? People are lazy? There aren't centuries of design history?

I think there's also a problem in that eBook readers are sold by publishers and booksellers, rather than hardware companies. Such companies have less of an incentive to make the hardware really good, because they're selling books regardless of whether people buy eBooks or paper books. Not sure how the profit margins compare.

When I was young, my dad asked me what I thought of a ballot initiative that would have restricted new billboards. I was just at the age of a dawning political consciousness, so I thought about it for a couple of days, then said something like this:

&gt; I hate billboards. But it’s bad for the government to tell people what they can put on their own land. It’s close to violating freedom of speech. Are we going to have a board that decides what is “advertising” and what is “valid” speech?

As I talked, my dad nodded and stroked his chin. But when I asked what he thought, he said he was still going to vote against the billboards. When I asked why, he paused and then gave this argument:

&gt; Fuck the billboards.

Problem: It's rare to have your position on an issue reversed by three words. I wasn't sure what was wrong with my argument, but I knew something was.

Over the next few years, I ran into the standard libertarian ideas: You don't need to compromise rights to restrict billboards. Private companies could build tollways and advertise that they were billboard-free. We could treat billboards as an externality and pay people not to have them. A corporation could buy the land for a city and sell restricted rights for sub-plots!

But when I read stuff like this, I always had "fuck the billboards" looming in the back of my mind. Slowly, it took on a meaning like this:

&gt; Alternative governance patterns are cool. But until they're proven viable, shouldn't we try to effectively use the patterns that exist now?

Deeper problem: This story worries me: If my dad had given this more explicit argument, would it have convinced me? If I had heard the Libertarian Reveries before "fuck the billboards", would I still think what I think now? Are all beliefs fake, the consequences of randomly hearing the right words at the right age to trigger an emotional reaction that will ferment for years and slowly transform us?

This reminds me of Taleb's thoughts on "being an aesthete" (don't remember for sure which book they're from; I want to say <span class="Formatted">_Fooled by Randomness_</span> though): that there are some places where he knows he is irrational, but also knows it isn't leading to negative consequences, and so just enjoys it because it makes him happy. Perhaps it's OK to ban billboards even if it doesn't align with our other values, because nothing too bad can possibly result, and, well, "fuck the billboards"?

<span class="PreProc" id="12763">@12763.</span> I find it really annoying that people recently studying systems of oppression, etc., have tried to overwrite the word "racism" with a completely different concept. There are two useful concepts here, one involving the explicit act of individually treating someone different based purely on their race, and one involving sociological structures that push consistently in one direction. These are both fantastically useful concepts and both things that should be fought. But they're not the same, at all, and it seems bonkers to me to consider it acceptable to linguistically treat them as the same thing.

John McWhorter suggests reverting to "prejudice" for the original meaning (which was common parlance before "racism" was coined). I like this approach and may try to follow it.

It treats coming up with the things you want to change/do and resolving to do them as the important part. But the important part, and the challenging part, is downstream: figuring out how to recover from your mistakes, alter your plans in response to new information, all the day-to-day stuff of living life. The "Resolution" makes no provision whatsoever for this. But in actuality, to succeed in changing your life, you don't even have to get the goal right at the start! You just have to get the process right.

People also often resolve on individual steps that would help them reach a goal, which artificially creates failure. The individual steps often don't work the first time and need to be tweaked -- <span class="Statement">cf.</span> everything about BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits method -- but because you didn't tie your "Resolution" back to a goal, it feels like you've failed when the step isn't quite right, so you just drop the whole thing instead of tweaking.

Here's an example I think about constantly: activists and intellectuals of the 70s and 80s felt absolutely sure that they were doing the right thing to battle nuclear power. At least, I've never read about any of them having a smidgen of doubt. Why would they? They were standing against nuclear weapons proliferation, and terrifying meltdowns like Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, and radioactive waste poisoning the water and soil and causing three-eyed fish. They were saving the world. Of course the greedy nuclear executives, the C. Montgomery Burnses, claimed that their good atom-smashing was different from the bad atom-smashing, but they would say that, wouldn't they?

We now know that, by tying up nuclear power in endless bureaucracy and driving its cost ever higher, on the principle that if nuclear is economically competitive then it ipso facto hasn't been made safe enough, what the antinuclear activists were really doing was to force an ever-greater reliance on fossil fuels. They thereby created the conditions for the climate catastrophe of today. They weren't saving the human future; they were destroying it. Their certainty, in opposing the march of a particular scary-looking technology, was as misplaced as it's possible to be. Our descendants will suffer the consequences.

Unless, of course, there's another twist in the story: for example, if the global warming from burning fossil fuels is the only thing that staves off another ice age, and therefore the antinuclear activists do turn out to have saved civilization after all.

Like, if you believe that relationships are mostly about people who are physically attracted to each other having sex, then sure this policy makes a lot of sense; you can always just find someone else. If you believe that people can randomly fall in love and be uniquely well-suited for each other, maybe with no more suitable match for either person, then such policies are obviously unjust. Presumably the actual truth is in the middle, but this was super interesting.)

<span class="PreProc" id="13061">@13061.</span> On such framings: I remember a story I read on the web a few years ago about a guy whose boss got free tickets with amazing seats at an NFL game or something of that nature. When he got back, the narrator asked him how it was. "Oh, it was terrible," he says. "The nachos were cold."

And the narrator went on to talk about how much it must suck to be someone for whom nachos that are slightly too cold can ruin a football game.

It's worth pointing out that this isn't about your tolerance for cold nachos, it's about the ability to evaluate experiences as a whole, rather than on their worst parts. Like for me, suppose I got some absolutely disgusting nachos -- the worst nachos I've ever had -- and they cost me $35. I'd certainly be telling the story of my horrendous $35 nachos years later, but I'd find that an amusing part of my (presumably overall good) game experience, both right away and later.

Actually, having had my car stolen is kind of similar. I've started to get a little annoyed when I update people on what happened in the last few months of my life that they think it must have been so awful. It already feels more like a useful life experience than something that I'm upset about, or that was hard. I had Marie to keep me company. I still got around the city fine. I learned what it was like not to have a car in Uptown Minneapolis (mostly OK, but sometimes really irritating). I had to postpone doing a few activities I otherwise would have enjoyed, but I just replaced them with other good things. There are a couple of funny stories in there.

<span class="PreProc" id="13171">@13171.</span> Random thought: Why is explicitly searching for a best friend not a thing? It would work basically like dating, except without the romantic part. Someone seems interesting, you "ask them out" by seeing if they're interested in trying to spend a bunch of one-on-one time with you talking about serious stuff quickly. If you keep feeling like yeah, this could be great, you keep doing it; if you're not sure anymore, you can back off (you don't have to end the relationship, you can just mutually agree to keep it a bit more casual). I think dating demonstrates that it's entirely possible to develop intimacy very quickly, and enjoyably, if you're intentional about it.

Somehow you're not allowed to say this is what you're after; like it somehow has to be an accident, or at least look like it is, when you get to know someone really well.

A key downside is, I think, that friendship is, as it stands, casual and generally lacking in minefields; you don't have to say your true feelings, so it creates fewer bad feelings when you don't become more intimate with someone, and you're less likely to lose friendships if there's a one-sided platonic attraction. On the other hand, I'd be willing to lose a few casual friends along the way if it meant I could get to know a couple people really well quickly! Five real friends, great life (<a href="#10215">#10215</a>). I might even put a higher priority on this than dating if it were an option; half the reason I like dating is that I get to know a bunch of interesting people well.

This feels like an option we deeply need as a society right now, actually, since we generally have fewer opportunities to meet people and are more likely to move around and lose the people we know in a place.

I do wonder if technological approaches like Bumble BFF, etc., would be more inclined to this sort of behavior, just because they inherently evoke some of the dating schema. Maybe I ought to give something along these lines a serious try, even just to be able to talk about how they function better, since I keep speculating on them!

The choice to include these independent conditions as 48 distinct experiments is not wrong, but it is a choice -- one that gives this paper 48 times the weight it might otherwise have -- and it is consequential. If instead of including it 48 times, the authors included it only once (averaging across all 48 "conditions"), the average rate of dishonesty in the coin-flip studies would increase from 30% to 35%. The meta-analysts' largely arbitrary decision of how to code a single paper decreases the dishonesty gap between coin-flip studies and die-roll studies by ~23% [12]. There is no right or wrong way to solve this issue, because there is no true proportion of Lindt-chocolate studies in the population. The problem is not with the meta-analysts' coding decisions. The problem is with the enterprise as a whole, with taking an arbitrary sample of studies that happened to have been conducted, averaging their results, and interpreting that average as something meaningful [13].

To drive this point home, consider that some studies are going to find low levels of selfish lying. For example, studies run on Franciscan nuns and studies that tempt you to lie to procure a (measly?) chocolate. If you run a bunch of such low-dishonesty studies using coin flips but not using die rolls, you'll be more likely to find that people are more honest in coin-flip paradigms. But if you instead do the opposite, and run a bunch of such low-dishonesty studies using die-rolls but not coin-flips, well, you'll be more likely to find the opposite: that people are more honest in die-roll paradigms.

Meta-analytic averages are not (meaningfully) capturing what happens at the center of some platonic distribution of "dishonesty in coin-flip tasks", because that distribution does not exist (see Colada [33].htm). They are (meaninglessly) capturing what researchers happened to do. And if they happened to do different things in coin-flip tasks than in die-roll tasks, well, then you're likely to find different results in coin-flip tasks than in die-roll tasks. And that meta-analyzed difference has no meaning.
